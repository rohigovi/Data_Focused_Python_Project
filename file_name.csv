We are consistently working to eliminate unnecessary friction at work, most importantly preserving the human experience. We don’t believe that people should have to change who they are nor waver their values in order to have a career.  ABOUT THE ROLE:This role will be part of a continually growing engineering department solving real world issues and be a key player in bringing to life new functionality for the system.As a Senior Engineer you will collaborate with the team to review requirements, build out functionality, squash bugs, and expand automated testing. During training, you’ll be expected to be proactive in your process and learn quickly.

The team will help with direction and design decisions, trade-off and risk recommendations, and general experience improvements.Your work will be leveraged by Nathan James to move away from 3rd party systems, improve existing workflows, enhance business processes, and reduce costs.ABOUT US:We understand, now more than ever, that time is finite.

Happiness means a lot of different things to different people, so we put in the work that goes into building an inclusive and supportive place for you to do the best work of your career. Our values and our benefits are designed to support a healthy relationship with your work. Our operating values provide the framework we use in building a happy and resilient organization.We also understand working for Nathan James isn’t the main function of your life, and we don’t expect that! We’ve found that a team member who will be happy and fulfilled as a remote team member at Nathan James is someone who values their personal life and identity outside of work. That’s why we don’t create mandatory team hangouts or events. We focus on how to improve collaboration, not forcing engagement.We collaborate best when we listen and learn from each other. We become stronger when we advocate new perspectives and viewpoints.

You have experience with API-first products, deploying features often and well tested, are passionate about automation, and are comfortable knowing when you need help or don’t know something.You love complex challenges, you’re driven by problem solving and not just duct tape solutions. If you don’t know how to do something you use existing documentation and your resourcefulness to dive-deep and figure it out. You don’t require constant hand-holding, but you’re not afraid to speak up when requirements aren’t clear or they require additional context and details.You have 6+ years of experience working in a LAMP/LEMP stack with Laravel and REST APIs. Additionally, experience with queues (Redis, RabbitMQ, etc), Vue, and/or DevOps is an added plus. You have at least 3+ years developing and deploying consumer or enterprise applications at scale. At a minimum, you must have deep interest and knowledge of the eCommerce landscape.You are proactive in your process and learn quickly, leveraging both software and documentation. You innately work on self improvement.You may have a degree or you might not, that’s not what we’re looking for. We care about what you can do and how you do it.This is a remote role, since we are a remote company. With the freedom and flexibility of a remote role comes the luxury to work in whichever manner helps you perform your best! However, this ideal is best coupled with an individual who has a keen ability to self regulate and self manage. Our team works from home offices, co-working spaces, and coffee shops. You’ll find us in places that foster effective writing, self-discipline, and comfort with open communication.If everything you’ve read so far is exciting you on a weird level, then you are the type of person who will thrive at Nathan James! BENEFITS & PERKS:   Our benefits aim to support a life well lived, both at and away from work.With these benefits, we want and expect you to take vacations, spend time with your family, be conscious of your wellness, invest in broadening your education, and strengthen your personal happiness.  HOW TO APPLY: Please submit an application here that speaks directly to this position. There are no right answers or cookie-cutter expectations.

You’ll hear from us about advancement to a short introduction interview. Our interviews are all remote by video chat (no software needed), with your future colleagues, on your schedule. Then on to a work sample review. You’ll get a chance to see the types of challenges you would be solving in this role.  We aim to make an offer and have this person start by October 2021. We appreciate your consideration in having Nathan James be part of your career. Our open conversation starts with this post.

Each year, trillions of dollars worth of B2B trade is transacted using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). EDI is difficult for modern businesses to work with. Convictional is changing that. 
 
Our Supplier Enablement Platform enables retailers and marketplaces to onboard, integrate, and transact with all of their suppliers. Convictional's API-driven infrastructure is used by large retailers like Staples, Indigo, Harry Rosen, and Equinox, and brands like Caraway, Detox Market, and Therabody. We recently raised a Series A financing to scale our impact to even more companies.
 
Convictional's platform is informed by thousands of hours of customer consultation and a deep appreciation for both the buyer and seller perspectives. We are continuing to learn about the massive value to be unlocked from all types of B2B trade, including marketplace, dropship and wholesale. We’re aiming at theoretical maximums, not feature-completeness, and intend to bring as many businesses along with us as we can.
 
Taking a new approach to an old problem is nothing special. Our team, and how we engage with each other, is. We are proud to be building a home for kind nerds who want to impact global trade. Our team is strengthened when we take a learning-first approach and seek out opportunities to debate the best customer-focused solutions. We value self-awareness and feel compelled to fully explore the hard questions. 
 
We are a fully distributed team with people located across Canada and the US. We encourage you to design your work schedule and environment so they’re optimal for you. We use email, not Slack. We default to no internal meetings and Deep Work Wednesdays. We expect you to go to coaching or therapy at least occasionally and adhere to 10% compound time.

We love our values
We’re building a fam, our chosen circle, around a set of values that guide how we work and interact with the world around us. Our cultural norms at work can’t be turned off when the computer’s away -- we live these in every part of our lives. Our team isn’t for everyone, so if you’re right for it, the following values should resonate strongly with how you live your life.

We’re intolerant to bad vibes, and genuinely love where we work (and want to keep it that way). We choose our fam by looking beyond a skillset - because roles can change - and surround ourselves with folks we want to spend our lives with.

We aim high and hire smart people to get there -- folks that use logic and critical thinking to make the best decisions. We look beyond the problem and quickly build context to come to the right solution; our ever-changing and high-pace environment requires a team of great autonomous thinkers. 

When we say “got it,” our team knows we’re owning it, we’re following through, and we’ll deliver beyond expectations. Put the effort into figuring things out yourself (hey, we’re all busy), and actively collaborate if you haven’t Got it; ownership also means knowing when to seek help and to never suffer in silence.

We’re a rare team of folks that genuinely love to work hard because we know that putting in the effort gets the win -- we’re the people that started our careers at the lemonade stand. Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle’s more fun when we’re winning together.

We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they’re pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There’s no hesitation in being direct; since we’re surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.

Workshops or co-creative activities;
Sketches and wireframes;

You are eager to establish, drive, and articulate the design vision for the product/s you oversee and promote shared understanding of our user’s goals, tasks, and workflows.
You have a personal obsession with the experience of both our clients and end-users and desire to deeply understand and advocate for their needs through all phases of projects.
You always take into account new and existing insights, technical constraints, and business needs to make data-informed decisions; you anticipate how decisions are made, persistently explore, and uncover new ways of solving problems.

From our work to replace district attorneys unwilling to punish violent police officers to pushing back against Silicon Valley enablers of white supremacists, Color Of Change has a track record of holding decision-makers - corporate and political - accountable to Black people.
ROLE SUMMARY
There has never been a more exciting time to work on technology at Color Of Change: the organization has been making deep investments in technology and data, including the recent hire of the organization’s first executive-level CTO. This scaling process includes the addition of new skill functions, including designers, product managers, engineers, and more to boost the overall capabilities of the team. We are creating cross-functional technology teams that build the software and data intelligence products needed to help our work reach the next level of impact.
With this increased capacity comes increased complexity. Due to time constraints and prioritization, the CTO will not be able to touch all the critical department functions and needs a partner in the running of the technology team.
KEY OBJECTIVES
The CTO will delegate important functions to her deputy so that she is able to focus on areas where she is uniquely equipped to lead. While the ultimate split of team responsibilities will depend on the profile of the hired candidate, we expect that the Deputy role will have day-to-day ownership of several key areas:

Work closely with the CTO to ensure important organization information is regularly shared with the team, and that important team information is regularly shared with the organization

Vendor management

Regularly review our vendor contracts to make sure we are getting what we need, and not paying for services we no longer use
Negotiate contracts with a resource stewardship mentality

Budgeting & Financial Management

Draft team budgets in coordination with team members
Work with the Finance team on reviewing budget-to-actuals and making adjustments as needed

Discrete Projects

Lead specific projects for which there is no clear natural owner, or when team capacity is stretched


Support the CTO as necessary

QUALIFICATIONS
We are looking for a creative and mature leader with vision and insight, recognizing that person could come from a range of backgrounds.
Some or all of these would be great to see in the ideal candidate’s background:

Experienced manager who understands what it takes to successfully run a complex team and navigate the accompanying people dynamics
An excellent project manager who can keep the trains running on time
Ready to wear many hats and do what it takes to support the CTO and ensure the team is successful
Demonstrated alignment with Color Of Change’s mission, and a strong commitment to racial and/or social justice
Budget management experience 
Experience working with cross-functional teams
Strong facilitation, prioritization, and influencing skills
Demonstrated experience and skills in running a remote, virtual team, including preparing for and running good virtual meetings
Experience and skill with collaboration tools like Asana, Slack, Miro, and others in order to help the team create strong internal processes
An ownership mentality
Willingness to engage with and execute on a plan, even in situations you may disagree on some of the elements
Orchestrate collaboration by removing roadblocks and fostering communication
Experience prioritizing competing demands
Demonstrated ability to manage and resolve conflict

Building tools to automate data verification and ensure the integrity of our reported metrics
Integrating data from multiple sources across internal and external partners
Working alongside Data Engineers and Project Managers to strive for greater functionality in our data systems

Career Progression! If you enjoy working in a fast-paced, innovative environment, you'll get on well here!


Remote and flexible working hours! We all have many spheres in our busy lives: family, fitness (well, some of us), work, study, and community interests.


Also, you could choose to work from our nice office in Madrid. In Serrano 88. Or maybe a mix of Remote and Office—it’s totally up to you!


Seeing your ideas become a reality—being part of a small and fast-growing start-up means you have plenty of chances to grow with us to the next level!


A young and international team of authentic professionals who are passionate about their product. We speak Spanish, English, German, Portuguese, and Lithuanian—take your pick!



Our recruitment process in a nutshell


After receiving your application, you will have a first Hangout with our People Manager if your profile goes through our first screening. It will be an easy-going conversation where our People Manager will tell you a little more about Rebellion Pay as a company and our culture and growth, and you will be given more details about the team which you can be part of.


If the interview with our People Manager goes well, we will invite you to a second Hangout with our CTO and CPO. Here they will explain to you better our product and technological stack, our features, and here is where you can also clarify any more technical questions—take advantage of it!


If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test! Important: our test has nothing to do with Rebellion Pay—we do not ask you to do any feature or solve a problem of our app. You have 1 week to solve this test. You can upload it to a repository and pass the test to our Engineering team so they can review it.


Finally, we invite you to the last Hangout—the test review, again with our CTO and CPO. It is important here that your test is working correctly so that everything goes as well as possible and you can be calm and confident during the test review.


Hope to see you here soon!

63,Front-end Engineer,surefoot,USA Only,"hi there, thanks for stopping by.
What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply.
what we do
We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in:

user experience research and design
full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)
data analytics
email

about your role and team
If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!
As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav – the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.
Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time – both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, “do the bare minimum”, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with “that's not in my job description” attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.
Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your “weird” show every once in awhile.
We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply. Now.
a day in the life of a front-end engineer

start your morning with a cup o' joe and fire up your computer to check emails, Slack and Asana.
it's 10:30am CST, time for our team Zoom stand-up to chit chat with teammates a bit, then talk through your priorities for the day and any blockers.
shortly after stand-up, you begin working on the big test in your queue – a navigation redesign for mobile and desktop devices.
once you've added the necessary events and configured the test in the testing tool, you'll pass it off to QA and take a break to refill your coffee or participate in some witty banter (complete with GIFs and custom emojis) in #watercooler.
as the day nears it's end, you'll patch a few bugs identified in QA, send the test to the strategic director for review and answer a few questions in Asana from your teammates about test details.
it's the first Wednesday of the month, so grab your beverage of choice and wrap up the day with the team at a Zoom virtual happy hour!

ready to apply?
Since we are a fully remote team, we have a somewhat atypical interview process. For the first step of the interview phase, we ask applicants to show basic competency in the necessary skill sets (don't worry, no hazing a la “live code fizzbuzz” is involved).
If all is well there, you'll move on to phase two which involves a Zoom video call to get to know one another a bit better. If we're feeling good about that, we'll contact your references.
And finally, if your references check out and confirm you're not a stabber, we'll ask you to do some actual paid work with us to determine fit for both parties.
To apply, please fill out our application form and be ready to submit a link to your code from this exercise.
 
----------
All applicants will receive a response. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds foster a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better business results. We strive to create workplaces that reflect the clients we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work. We are an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are also committed to working with candidates from all ability levels throughout the recruitment process to ensure they have what they need to be at their best. If you need accommodation during the application or interview process, please contact us to begin a conversation about your individual accessibility needs throughout the hiring process.

71,Finance Administrator,Empire Flippers LLC,Anywhere,"The Details to Keep in Mind
 
Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire right away.
When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work and teach you about each department within the business. 
As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into the low-level tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later becoming an independent fully fledged Finance Administrator for Empire Flippers.
It’s important to stress How We Work – which is from anywhere in the world. We are results driven and completely remote (pre-pandemic even), which for us equals total freedom! 
If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.
 
Love it. What’s the Catch?
 
We love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.
A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.
Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. 
Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer’s questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.
A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.
We focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. 
We’re made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this Finance Administrator position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.
 
What Skills Are Needed? 
 
We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.
You must have experience or training. We are looking for a skilled finance administrator with at least some experience/training in an accounting or finance role. The ideal candidate will use their experience to help create and make improvements to our financial processes. 
Numbers are your second language – Regardless of your experience, you will need to love numbers to excel at this role. We are looking for someone who lives and thrives in a spreadsheet. You will need to be diligent with figures and have that reflected in your work. 
You’re a confident and proactive self-starter. You will face obstacles and challenges. A buyer might be late on their earnout payment and you will need to chase them. An affiliate dashboard may not generate the reports we need and you will need to follow up with their support team. It will be down to you to manage that process and ensure everything is nicely kept up. 
Technical experience. To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 
You’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.
 
What’s the Finance Administrator Position Like? 
 
While we are an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not overly corporate. You’ll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.
It has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us. 
When you first come on board as a Finance Administrator, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company.  
You will become well versed in all of our finance processes, from how to reconcile the inventory of an eCommerce business to pulling revenue data from various affiliate dashboards. 
Once you have the basics down, we would love to lean on your accountancy background and make improvements to the current processes we have in place. No one in the team is tied to our processes and we actively encourage improvement across the board. 
You might be wondering, though … what does your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?
 
Here is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):
 

Reviewing the inventory levels of eCommerce businesses and creating spreadsheets of the total cost price inventory dollar amount. 
Running revenue reports for affiliate sites and calculating the net revenue due to both buyer and seller.  
Work with buyers and sellers to review these reconciliation amounts and answer any questions they have on the numbers. 
Work closely with other Migration team members to aid them with any specific reconciliation/accountancy work that needs to be completed on the deals they are managing
Work closely with the Migration Supervisor to improve our current reconciliation processes. 
Follow up with buyers for any payments due on deals that include an earnout. This typically means emailing/calling the buyer a few days before payment is due and also chasing if not paid.  
Review deals with a performance-related earnout to calculate the amount due to the seller. This typically means reviewing P&Ls/revenue reports to calculate whether or not a business has reached a certain benchmark over the selected time period.  
You will eventually take full responsibility for managing all of the earnouts included in our deals. 
Track and forecast different metrics related to earnouts. 

Ultimately, you’ll help our team grow and thrive by handling the numbers side of the migration process. 
 
What is a Finance Administrator for the Migration Team? 
 
The role will work closely with the supervisor and individual team members to carry out various financial tasks related to the process of buying/selling a business. 
You will also be responsible for reviewing and managing all of our earnouts and earnout processes. We currently have roughly 80 active earnouts in progress at any one time. In 2021, earnouts will also account for nearly 15% of our overall net fees target, meaning this role will have a direct impact on our bottom line. 
The ideal candidate will be extremely numbers-oriented and will have experience directly relating to financial/inventory reconciliation or management. The new hire will be our ‘go-to numbers person’ in the team and will help us to sharpen up our processes across the board.
We are looking to bring on a talented professional to join our Migration Department in the role of Finance Administrator. Training will commence at the start of January and run approximately 8-12 weeks. 
While the Migration team works during business hours in multiple time zones, the role itself is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world (*see USA resident requirements below). Be it the beaches in Mexico or in a mountain resort in the Swiss Alps – the choice is yours. 
This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth, and there is no sign of it slowing down. 
In order to keep hitting our goals, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying, selling, and investing in online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before. 
Are you ready to get started?
If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position.
 
What’s the Opportunity? 
 
Becoming a Finance Administrator makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers. 
You will represent our brand by working with buyers/sellers and promoting Empire Flipper’s company reputation as a great place to buy/sell a business while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. 
Your work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. You should have at least some direct experience or training in an accountancy role.
If you’re a strong numbers person and comfortable with various accountancy practices, we’d like to meet you.
Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours.
We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. 
We are going to rely on your experience to make our earnout process better and smoother for our customers and team. 
When you first start off, you will be training with our Migration Supervisor and other senior migration team members for 8-12 weeks. We typically meet in person during this time, but due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, we are assessing travel requirements during this process and will know more as the hire date gets closer.
Speaking of travel, our company holds bi-annual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building – we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. We are planning another meetup in the last quarter of 2022 (location TBD). So dust off your passport, and we’ll aim to see you then! 
For the first six months, you will be paid $2,700 USD per month during the probation period. After six months, you will be introduced to our compensation plan where you will earn a base pay of $3,000 USD per month plus a performance-based bonus. 
Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage. We also offer equity stake in the company.

87,Lead Golang Engineer,JustWatch GmbH,Anywhere,"The Marketing Technology team is the most important part of the B2B side of JustWatch. We are the first fully Movie & TV show entertainment-centred marketing platform worldwide and had to build our tools from scratch. Our custom-built marketing platform allows our campaigns team to execute a volume of campaigns that, if done manually, would require a much bigger team.
 
Some of the topics we have recently worked on are:
- adding different advertising channels with their various API quirks
- expanding our system to cover new workflows as required by evolving campaign requirements
- and (as usual) eliminating bugs
 
The biggest challenge now is utilizing ML and algorithms to run campaigns with ridiculous efficiency and much better targeting.
 
Our stack
 
The marketing stack is based on services written in Golang, running in Kubernetes managed by Google Cloud Platform. We store data in PostgreSQL and monitor everything through Prometheus.
We use several advertising channels (and their APIs) such as Facebook and Google, and help our BI team to build relevant reports using a data warehouse based on Snowflake.
 
How we work, and what’s in it for you

Freedom and responsibility


We share context on what matters to the business. The delivery is up to you. That also means we don’t track vacation days, have flexible working hours, and allow working remotely


No company-wide Scrum or other enforced processes. We are agile without the artificial overhead


Great colleagues and a creative environment


We prefer asking forgiveness than asking for permission


Direct communication, no bloated hierarchy


Frequent open, honest and bi-directional feedback


What we expect from you

We are interested in the value you can bring rather than years of experience, the knowledge of every piece of our tech stack or well-curated references. Do you have a side project? Have you failed or succeeded at your own startup? Are you an expert in a piece of our stack?  Incredibly driven? Entrepreneurial? These are the achievements and traits we're interested in.

 
As a guideline for technology and skills

Experience as a backend engineer, deep familiarity with Go (Golang) language.


Advanced ability to work with relational databases, preferably Postgres.


Domain experience with DMPs, DSPs or within the AdTech/marketing tech ecosystem.


Experience leading a backend engineering team.

If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.   
 
The job can be fully remote or hybrid (our office is in Berlin and if you decide to relocate - we will fully support it)
 
We embrace our entrepreneurial responsibilities. Through our 6-figure environmental and social impact budget, we offset every employee’s carbon footprint, give back to the community, support causes that matter, and have recently implemented a wellbeing and mental health programme.

How to apply:  
 
Show your interest in any way that works for you, we simplified the application process -  send us whatever you have or just your Linkedin and a brief message explaining why you are a great fit for this role.

92,Growth Product Manager,Microverse,Anywhere,"Please make sure to read the application thoroughly and follow the appropriate application process, incomplete applications will not be considered.
About Microverse
We believe the place where you are born shouldn't determine your opportunities in life. We provide access to global opportunities by offering a world-class education no matter where you come from.
Microverse is an online school for software developers where students learn to work remotely with people from around the world. Students don't pay tuition until they get hired and start a global career. As of today, we have students in 100+ countries, and more than 90% of our alumni get a job within 6 months with an average salary increase of 240% working for companies like Microsoft, and VMWare.
We are backed by amazing investors worldwide, including Y Combinator, Northzone, General Catalyst, and many world-class angel investors, such as Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit (the creator of Gmail), Kevin Hartz (the founder of Eventbrite), and Erica Brescia (Github's COO).
We are a passionate and fast-moving team of global citizens working remotely from 12+ countries. Being remote-first and transparent, we take pride in the amazing remote culture we are building, while also making time for in-person time with team members around the world. We are a small but mighty team of curious, life-long learners, who love tackling challenges and helping shape the future of education.
Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. We're on a mission to change that. With the recent closing of our Series A, there has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team.
Job Description
We are looking for an experienced, hands-on Growth Product Manager (PM) who will be responsible for launching innovative products and experiences to drive growth at Microverse. You’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution of key growth product initiatives initially focused on unlocking remarkable experiences for our applicants and engaging them as students in the Microverse program.
We use No Code tools like Integromat and Zapier to integrate across numerous third-party tools, so we're able to automate workflows and processes outside of traditional software development. We're looking for a scrappy PM interested in getting their hands dirty designing and building prototypes themselves to quickly drive change. Experimenting and iterating will be a big part of your day-to-day work as you strive to achieve your OKRs.
The Growth area will start as a squad of one. Though you'll have access to designers and developers on our Program squad to collaborate with, the right person for this role is excited to ideate, prototype, and launch your own work. The Growth Product Manager will report to the Head of Product & Learning, and day-to-day you'll work with cross-functional team members, particularly with Marketing and Admissions.
We are currently growing our Product Development teams nearly from the ground up. You'll get an opportunity to be a highly impactful member of a fast-growing, mission-driven start-up with ambitious goals and a strong culture of care and collaboration.
While we are highly communicative and collaborative, we are also highly asynchronous and strive to abide by remote-first best practices. You'll send a lot of Loom videos, respond to Twist threads, and have comment conversations on documentation before meetings, so we can all stay off Zoom and maintain our flexible working schedules.
Duties and Responsibilities

Lead a team through the ideation, technical development, and launch of innovative products that drive Growth (initially focused on student acquisition, but open to other growth areas of the company like expanding employer partnerships).
Monitor the market and develop competitive analyses to drive Growth product development strategy.
Actively and compassionately listen to our applicants and develop clear user personas we can use in product discovery and development.
Balance your deep understanding of our user needs with our OKRs and business needs to define a product strategy and prioritize opportunities and requests accordingly.
Evaluate opportunities based on business feasibility, and collaborate with operational teams to ensure cost effectiveness of solutions.
Write product requirements, user stories, and be willing to dive into prototyping and launching Growth products with whatever tool is the best fit, either utilizing current tools we use like Integromat, Zapier, Gather.town, Webflow, etc. or adding a new one to the mix.
Develop products in an iterative way with a focus on MVPs and running experiments to ensure the viability of changes before cementing them into the service.
Perform idea feedback collection from applicants, students, and staff and run a product discovery process to turn it into a refined backlog prioritized for development work, initially by you and later by other designers and developers.
Develop business requirements and specification documents.
Develop KPIs and agile/development metrics for measuring progress at team and feature levels.

Education, Skills, and Experience

5+ years of experience in Growth / Product Management.
Proven track record for driving growth using a variety of models.
Highly structured and analytical thinking.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a track record of effectively prioritizing, communicating, and coordinating efforts across teams.
Highly empathetic toward our users and sensitive to their particular needs.
Experience prototyping and launching using third-party tools and no-code integration solutions (like Integromat).
Again: tools, tools, tools! You know tools, or know there is probably an existing tool out there and are not afraid to find it and add it to our No Code ecosystem if it makes sense to do so.
Excited by defining opportunities and developing solutions.
Love experimenting and following it up with hands-on iteration to drive change quickly.
Ability to conduct qualitative user interviews and quantitative research to explain and validate findings, without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.
Experience taking new product ideas from zero to one; skilled at iterative sprints.
Experience using analytics and data to inform product decisions and measure post-launch impact.
Experience leveraging a wide variety of product-based analytics and a method for balancing instinct and data.
Experience working in a startup (fast-growth environment & technology-focused company).

You Ideally...

Have driven growth in a start-up
Have a background in design that you can bring to designing experiences and workflows to drive growth
Understand the best practices in software development
Have worked remotely and asynchronously, especially for a startup
Will write the word ""cake"" somewhere in your cover letter

What are your pronouns?
Is there anything about Legible that you connect with?

About Legible
Come join us on our mission to empower and connect authors and readers through open access to a global reading and publishing platform. Legible is making books beautiful and accessible.
At Legible, we're transforming the world of stories; not just by creating a new and beautiful eBook platform to experience, but by making stories truly accessible. That means being available to everyone, everywhere, on any device, as well as working with assistive technologies, and making sure local and meaningful stories aren't buried by search bias. Surrounding that, we're going to be creating fantastic new ways for authors and readers to connect, with features to delight publishers big and tiny alike.
To make that magic happen takes amazing people. Sometimes that comes in the form of someone with untapped potential who needs to be given a shot, who wants a place where they can be heard and engaged, and sometimes amazing people come in the form of those seeking to quietly lead by example, sharing wisdom and wanting to mentor others. 
We believe in the value of having a diverse team. Different backgrounds, upbringings, lifestyles, and perspectives make us stronger, wiser, and more capable. If you're looking for somewhere that wants you for the awesome person you are, and not just what you can do, we just might be the place for you.
Our Community Values: Accessibility, Sustainability, Beauty, and Integrity
Why Legible? 
Legible is a startup with a heart - a company that values equity and diversity at its very core; It is a place to grow and experience different areas of the business. We are a small but mighty team, who are just turning the page on a new and exciting chapter of growth. 
We offer:

A flexible working schedule
Great paid time off package, including a paid winter break
A comprehensive benefits package
A multitude of avenues for career growth and change

“Systemic racism is a machine that runs whether we pull the levers or not, and by just letting it be, we are responsible for what it produces. We have to actually dismantle the machine if we want to make change.” - Ijeoma Oluo, So You Want to Talk About Race
At Legible, we strive for diversity and inclusion to create a genuinely healthy and equitable workplace for everyone. We are committed to the ongoing process of building a culture of respect at every level, ensuring that everyone feels safe, supported, and valued.
Let's be real: employee handbooks always talk a lot about diversity and inclusion, but in the actual day-to-day, employees knowingly or unknowingly indulge in microaggressions toward BIPOC colleagues, claim that “sexism goes both ways,” and so on. At Legible, we know that oppression is systemic and structural. Cishet privilege, non-disabled privilege, white privilege, male privilege—these are real and have consequences for people. We're aware that being marginalized at work causes real distress, especially when accountability doesn't seem to exist. 
How is Legible going to dismantle the machine and what makes us different? It starts here; everyone has an opportunity to join Legible and make a difference - our hiring process is fair and equitable. As a company, we will be devoted to providing regular training and info sessions to our employees to ensure that we are aware of our privileges and will work to address microaggressions on a daily basis. One look at Legible.com will show how committed we are to diversity and inclusivity. We are a company that will beautifully entwine, celebrates, and support diverse cultures and varying beliefs. 
A few years ago, an interviewer asked Lin-Manuel Miranda, the creator of the Broadway smash-hit Hamilton, why his cast was so diverse. Miranda replied, ""That's just what happens when you go looking for the very best people!"" At Legible, we couldn't agree more! 
Legible recognizes the right for human beings to self-identify. You are valued, safe, and supported.
To be considered for this position, you must be eligible to work in Canada and pass background checks
Compensation for this role is $70,000 - $80,000 per year - salary is dependent on experience.

ABOUT US
Roadmunk is a privately held, high-growth startup in the rapidly emerging market of Product Management software. Roadmunk was born out of a problem our founders experienced personally: there was no simple way for product managers to collect feedback, surface customer-driven insights and create roadmaps using a single platform. So we went out and built it for ourselves, making sure it was collaborative, beautifully designed and secure. 
Today, we are home to thousands of forward-thinking product teams including those from organizations like Disney, Sonos and Under Armour. 
In the fall of 2019, Roadmunk was 12th in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards for its rapid revenue growth and bold innovation.

Experience using data to inform decisions while still having a high degree of bias for action
Ability to put yourself in our customers’ shoes and have deep customer empathy
Curiosity and enthusiasm to continuously learn and improve, and the humility to ask for help when needed

Taking a new approach to an old problem is nothing special. Our team, and how we engage with each other, is. We are proud to be building a home for kind nerds who want to impact global trade. Our team is strengthened when we take a learning-first approach and seek out opportunities to debate the best customer-focused solutions. We value self-awareness and feel compelled to fully explore the hard questions.

We love our values
We’re building a fam, our chosen circle, around a set of values that guide how we work and interact with the world around us. Our cultural norms at work can’t be turned off when the computer’s away -- we live these in every part of our lives. Our team isn’t for everyone, so if you’re right for it, the following values should resonate strongly with how you live your life.

We’re intolerant to bad vibes, and genuinely love where we work (and want to keep it that way). We choose our fam by looking beyond a skillset - because roles can change - and surround ourselves with folks we want to spend our lives with.

We aim high and hire smart people to get there -- folks that use logic and critical thinking to make the best decisions. We look beyond the problem and quickly build context to come to the right solution; our ever-changing and high-pace environment requires a team of great autonomous thinkers. 

When we say “got it,” our team knows we’re owning it, we’re following through, and we’ll deliver beyond expectations. Put the effort into figuring things out yourself (hey, we’re all busy), and actively collaborate if you haven’t Got it; ownership also means knowing when to seek help and to never suffer in silence.

We’re a rare team of folks that genuinely love to work hard because we know that putting in the effort gets the win -- we’re the people that started our careers at the lemonade stand. Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle’s more fun when we’re winning together.

We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they’re pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There’s no hesitation in being direct; since we’re surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.

Continuous learning and development is strongly encouraged. Everyone gets a personal development budget which they can put towards things like books, courses and conferences, and reserve times every fortnight for learning new things or working on creative side-projects.
 
We’re aware of the challenges of being a remote worker and work hard to foster team-spirit. We encourage remote chats over coffee with colleagues and have regular team meetings to keep everyone up to date with goings on across the company and introduce new joiners.
 
We believe that we are in the process of successfully building a company that people enjoy working for. Our employees should feel valued, supported, and fulfilled. We know that there’s always more that we could be doing and have regular conversations about what we can improve. Everyone’s opinion is important and all input is taken on board.

Color Of Change is one of the largest Black-led racial justice organizations in the country with more than 7 million email and SMS subscribers. We specialize in providing our members with easy, strategic actions to take in response to racial injustices - that when added with the voices of others - create the leverage for winning real-world change for Black people. From our work to replace district attorneys unwilling to punish violent police officers to pushing back against Silicon Valley enablers of white supremacists, Color Of Change has a track record of holding decision-makers - corporate and political - accountable to Black people.
ROLE SUMMARY
There has never been a more exciting time to work on technology at Color Of Change: the organization has been making deep investments in technology and data, including the recent hire of the organization’s first executive-level CTO. This scaling process includes the addition of new skill functions, including designers, product managers, engineers, and more to boost the overall capabilities of the team. We are creating cross-functional technology teams that build the software and data intelligence products needed to help our work reach the next level of impact.
With this increased capacity comes increased complexity. Due to time constraints and prioritization, the CTO will not be able to touch all the critical department functions and needs a partner in the running of the technology team.
KEY OBJECTIVES
The CTO will delegate important functions to her deputy so that she is able to focus on areas where she is uniquely equipped to lead. While the ultimate split of team responsibilities will depend on the profile of the hired candidate, we expect that the Deputy role will have day-to-day ownership of several key areas:
Team performance management

Hiring, including drafting job descriptions and engaging with the internal HR team, and when necessary, external recruiters
Goal-setting processes, both at the team and individual levels
Ensuring quality management practices across the team, including strong 1:1s, performance reviews, and related processes
Taking the lead on HR processes for the team

Team coordination and communication

Ownership of team meetings, including agenda development, facilitation, and post-meeting follow-through
Champion best practices in internal communication across our collaboration platforms (Asana, Slack, etc.)
Work closely with the CTO to ensure important organization information is regularly shared with the team, and that important team information is regularly shared with the organization

Vendor management

Regularly review our vendor contracts to make sure we are getting what we need, and not paying for services we no longer use
Negotiate contracts with a resource stewardship mentality

Budgeting & Financial Management

Draft team budgets in coordination with team members
Work with the Finance team on reviewing budget-to-actuals and making adjustments as needed

Discrete Projects

Lead specific projects for which there is no clear natural owner, or when team capacity is stretched


Support the CTO as necessary

QUALIFICATIONS
We are looking for a creative and mature leader with vision and insight, recognizing that person could come from a range of backgrounds.
Some or all of these would be great to see in the ideal candidate’s background:

Experienced manager who understands what it takes to successfully run a complex team and navigate the accompanying people dynamics
An excellent project manager who can keep the trains running on time
Ready to wear many hats and do what it takes to support the CTO and ensure the team is successful
Demonstrated alignment with Color Of Change’s mission, and a strong commitment to racial and/or social justice
Budget management experience 
Experience working with cross-functional teams
Strong facilitation, prioritization, and influencing skills
Demonstrated experience and skills in running a remote, virtual team, including preparing for and running good virtual meetings
Experience and skill with collaboration tools like Asana, Slack, Miro, and others in order to help the team create strong internal processes
An ownership mentality
Willingness to engage with and execute on a plan, even in situations you may disagree on some of the elements
Orchestrate collaboration by removing roadblocks and fostering communication
Experience prioritizing competing demands
Demonstrated ability to manage and resolve conflict
Excellent written and verbal communication skills with a willingness to give (and receive) feedback.

Uken’s foray into narrative games is an exciting opportunity for the company. 
 
We consider our Ukenites to be data-driven designers, technologists, and artists. Through collaboration, we pair the craft of design with feedback and data to deliver a pace and rhythm in each game session that immerses our audience and engages them for years. We have a quirky, nerdy culture that fosters creativity, collaboration, quality ideas, innovation, and a data-driven mindset. We believe in moving quickly and improving constantly and that mantra is reflected in the weekly updates we make to our games and internal technologies. We have an appetite for pushing technical boundaries but with a focus on practical use.

Our commitment to Engineering and Technology is also seen in our service-oriented architecture with well-modularized responsibilities that allow us to build, maintain and scale our applications.

This role is intended for a candidate with a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals.

Debugging discrepancy issues that come up in the ETL (e.g. misaligned metrics with 3rd parties, duplicates, failures in the ETL, performance bottlenecks)
Building tools to automate data verification and ensure the integrity of our reported metrics
Integrating data from multiple sources across internal and external partners
Working alongside Data Engineers and Project Managers to strive for greater functionality in our data systems

 
Your background should include:

Experience with object-oriented, functional, and scripting languages e.g.: Scala, Python, Java
SQL skills
Experience with relational SQL and NoSQL databases such as including Redshift, Postgres, Redis, and MySQL
Experience with tools used for large scale data processing: Spark, Hadoop, Kafka
Experience with cloud services such as Amazon AWS 

 
It'd be a big plus if you have:

Knowledge of message queuing, stream processing, and highly scalable ‘big data’ technologies
Understanding of the different federated querying, data warehousing, and BI technologies and how they work together to form a Data Platform.
Knowledge of Machine Learning and experience implementing ML applications

Also, you could choose to work from our nice office in Madrid. In Serrano 88. Or maybe a mix of Remote and Office—it’s totally up to you!


Seeing your ideas become a reality—being part of a small and fast-growing start-up means you have plenty of chances to grow with us to the next level!


A young and international team of authentic professionals who are passionate about their product. We speak Spanish, English, German, Portuguese, and Lithuanian—take your pick!



Our recruitment process in a nutshell


After receiving your application, you will have a first Hangout with our People Manager if your profile goes through our first screening. It will be an easy-going conversation where our People Manager will tell you a little more about Rebellion Pay as a company and our culture and growth, and you will be given more details about the team which you can be part of.


If the interview with our People Manager goes well, we will invite you to a second Hangout with our CTO and CPO. Here they will explain to you better our product and technological stack, our features, and here is where you can also clarify any more technical questions—take advantage of it!


If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test! Important: our test has nothing to do with Rebellion Pay—we do not ask you to do any feature or solve a problem of our app. You have 1 week to solve this test. You can upload it to a repository and pass the test to our Engineering team so they can review it.


Finally, we invite you to the last Hangout—the test review, again with our CTO and CPO. It is important here that your test is working correctly so that everything goes as well as possible and you can be calm and confident during the test review.

63,Front-end Engineer,surefoot,USA Only,"hi there, thanks for stopping by.
What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply.
what we do
We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in:

user experience research and design
full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)
data analytics
email

about your role and team
If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!
As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav – the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.
Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time – both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, “do the bare minimum”, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with “that's not in my job description” attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.
Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your “weird” show every once in awhile.
We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply. Now.
a day in the life of a front-end engineer

start your morning with a cup o' joe and fire up your computer to check emails, Slack and Asana.
it's 10:30am CST, time for our team Zoom stand-up to chit chat with teammates a bit, then talk through your priorities for the day and any blockers.
shortly after stand-up, you begin working on the big test in your queue – a navigation redesign for mobile and desktop devices.
once you've added the necessary events and configured the test in the testing tool, you'll pass it off to QA and take a break to refill your coffee or participate in some witty banter (complete with GIFs and custom emojis) in #watercooler.
as the day nears it's end, you'll patch a few bugs identified in QA, send the test to the strategic director for review and answer a few questions in Asana from your teammates about test details.
it's the first Wednesday of the month, so grab your beverage of choice and wrap up the day with the team at a Zoom virtual happy hour!

role requirements

2+ years experience as a front-end developer

salary and benefits details
The position is full-time W-2 and open to U.S.-based applicants only. No Visa sponsorship is provided.

Base salary: $80,000 to $100,000 (depending on experience)
benefits and perks

fully-remote team (even pre-COVID!)
health insurance – we pay 80% of your premium, up to $400

$2,000 technology / WFH office budget
11 paid holidays
two 1/2 day Fridays per month

company-paid all-hands trips
Climate Neutral smart thermostat reimbursement
new hire and client referral bonuses
$400 learning budget
client discounts
…more as the company grows, with your input solicited on benefits that matter to you!



ready to apply?
Since we are a fully remote team, we have a somewhat atypical interview process. For the first step of the interview phase, we ask applicants to show basic competency in the necessary skill sets (don't worry, no hazing a la “live code fizzbuzz” is involved).
If all is well there, you'll move on to phase two which involves a Zoom video call to get to know one another a bit better. If we're feeling good about that, we'll contact your references.
And finally, if your references check out and confirm you're not a stabber, we'll ask you to do some actual paid work with us to determine fit for both parties.
To apply, please fill out our application form and be ready to submit a link to your code from this exercise.
 
----------
All applicants will receive a response. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds foster a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better business results. We strive to create workplaces that reflect the clients we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work. We are an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are also committed to working with candidates from all ability levels throughout the recruitment process to ensure they have what they need to be at their best. If you need accommodation during the application or interview process, please contact us to begin a conversation about your individual accessibility needs throughout the hiring process.

71,Finance Administrator,Empire Flippers LLC,Anywhere,"The Details to Keep in Mind
 
Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire right away.
When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work and teach you about each department within the business. 
As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into the low-level tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later becoming an independent fully fledged Finance Administrator for Empire Flippers.
It’s important to stress How We Work – which is from anywhere in the world. We are results driven and completely remote (pre-pandemic even), which for us equals total freedom! 
If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.
 
Love it. What’s the Catch?
 
We love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.
A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.
Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. 
Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer’s questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.
A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.
We focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. 
We’re made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this Finance Administrator position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.
 
What Skills Are Needed? 
 
We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.
You must have experience or training. We are looking for a skilled finance administrator with at least some experience/training in an accounting or finance role. The ideal candidate will use their experience to help create and make improvements to our financial processes. 
Numbers are your second language – Regardless of your experience, you will need to love numbers to excel at this role. We are looking for someone who lives and thrives in a spreadsheet. You will need to be diligent with figures and have that reflected in your work. 
You’re a confident and proactive self-starter. You will face obstacles and challenges. A buyer might be late on their earnout payment and you will need to chase them. An affiliate dashboard may not generate the reports we need and you will need to follow up with their support team. It will be down to you to manage that process and ensure everything is nicely kept up. 
Technical experience. To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 
You’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.
 
What’s the Finance Administrator Position Like? 
 
While we are an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not overly corporate. You’ll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.
It has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us. 
When you first come on board as a Finance Administrator, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company.  
You will become well versed in all of our finance processes, from how to reconcile the inventory of an eCommerce business to pulling revenue data from various affiliate dashboards. 
Once you have the basics down, we would love to lean on your accountancy background and make improvements to the current processes we have in place. No one in the team is tied to our processes and we actively encourage improvement across the board. 
You might be wondering, though … what does your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?
 
Here is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):
 

Reviewing the inventory levels of eCommerce businesses and creating spreadsheets of the total cost price inventory dollar amount. 
Running revenue reports for affiliate sites and calculating the net revenue due to both buyer and seller.  
Work with buyers and sellers to review these reconciliation amounts and answer any questions they have on the numbers. 
Work closely with other Migration team members to aid them with any specific reconciliation/accountancy work that needs to be completed on the deals they are managing
Work closely with the Migration Supervisor to improve our current reconciliation processes. 
Follow up with buyers for any payments due on deals that include an earnout. This typically means emailing/calling the buyer a few days before payment is due and also chasing if not paid.  
Review deals with a performance-related earnout to calculate the amount due to the seller. This typically means reviewing P&Ls/revenue reports to calculate whether or not a business has reached a certain benchmark over the selected time period.  
You will eventually take full responsibility for managing all of the earnouts included in our deals. 
Track and forecast different metrics related to earnouts. 

Ultimately, you’ll help our team grow and thrive by handling the numbers side of the migration process. 
 
What is a Finance Administrator for the Migration Team? 
 
The role will work closely with the supervisor and individual team members to carry out various financial tasks related to the process of buying/selling a business. 
You will also be responsible for reviewing and managing all of our earnouts and earnout processes. We currently have roughly 80 active earnouts in progress at any one time. In 2021, earnouts will also account for nearly 15% of our overall net fees target, meaning this role will have a direct impact on our bottom line. 
The ideal candidate will be extremely numbers-oriented and will have experience directly relating to financial/inventory reconciliation or management. The new hire will be our ‘go-to numbers person’ in the team and will help us to sharpen up our processes across the board.
We are looking to bring on a talented professional to join our Migration Department in the role of Finance Administrator. Training will commence at the start of January and run approximately 8-12 weeks. 
While the Migration team works during business hours in multiple time zones, the role itself is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world (*see USA resident requirements below). Be it the beaches in Mexico or in a mountain resort in the Swiss Alps – the choice is yours. 
This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth, and there is no sign of it slowing down. 
In order to keep hitting our goals, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying, selling, and investing in online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before. 
Are you ready to get started?
If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position.
 
What’s the Opportunity? 
 
Becoming a Finance Administrator makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers. 
You will represent our brand by working with buyers/sellers and promoting Empire Flipper’s company reputation as a great place to buy/sell a business while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. 
Your work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. You should have at least some direct experience or training in an accountancy role.
If you’re a strong numbers person and comfortable with various accountancy practices, we’d like to meet you.
Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours.
We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. 
We are going to rely on your experience to make our earnout process better and smoother for our customers and team. 
When you first start off, you will be training with our Migration Supervisor and other senior migration team members for 8-12 weeks. We typically meet in person during this time, but due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, we are assessing travel requirements during this process and will know more as the hire date gets closer.
Speaking of travel, our company holds bi-annual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building – we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. We are planning another meetup in the last quarter of 2022 (location TBD). So dust off your passport, and we’ll aim to see you then! 
For the first six months, you will be paid $2,700 USD per month during the probation period. After six months, you will be introduced to our compensation plan where you will earn a base pay of $3,000 USD per month plus a performance-based bonus. 
Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage. We also offer equity stake in the company.

87,Lead Golang Engineer,JustWatch GmbH,Anywhere,"The Marketing Technology team is the most important part of the B2B side of JustWatch. We are the first fully Movie & TV show entertainment-centred marketing platform worldwide and had to build our tools from scratch. Our custom-built marketing platform allows our campaigns team to execute a volume of campaigns that, if done manually, would require a much bigger team.
 
Some of the topics we have recently worked on are:
- adding different advertising channels with their various API quirks
- expanding our system to cover new workflows as required by evolving campaign requirements
- and (as usual) eliminating bugs
 
The biggest challenge now is utilizing ML and algorithms to run campaigns with ridiculous efficiency and much better targeting.
 
Our stack
 
The marketing stack is based on services written in Golang, running in Kubernetes managed by Google Cloud Platform. We store data in PostgreSQL and monitor everything through Prometheus.
We use several advertising channels (and their APIs) such as Facebook and Google, and help our BI team to build relevant reports using a data warehouse based on Snowflake.
 
How we work, and what’s in it for you

Freedom and responsibility


We share context on what matters to the business. The delivery is up to you. That also means we don’t track vacation days, have flexible working hours, and allow working remotely


No company-wide Scrum or other enforced processes. We are agile without the artificial overhead


Great colleagues and a creative environment


We prefer asking forgiveness than asking for permission


Direct communication, no bloated hierarchy


Frequent open, honest and bi-directional feedback


What we expect from you

We are interested in the value you can bring rather than years of experience, the knowledge of every piece of our tech stack or well-curated references. Do you have a side project? Have you failed or succeeded at your own startup? Are you an expert in a piece of our stack?  Incredibly driven? Entrepreneurial? These are the achievements and traits we're interested in.

 
As a guideline for technology and skills

Experience as a backend engineer, deep familiarity with Go (Golang) language.


Advanced ability to work with relational databases, preferably Postgres.


Domain experience with DMPs, DSPs or within the AdTech/marketing tech ecosystem.


Experience leading a backend engineering team.

If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.   
 
The job can be fully remote or hybrid (our office is in Berlin and if you decide to relocate - we will fully support it)
 
We embrace our entrepreneurial responsibilities. Through our 6-figure environmental and social impact budget, we offset every employee’s carbon footprint, give back to the community, support causes that matter, and have recently implemented a wellbeing and mental health programme. 
 
Read more about our culture in our blog post and Talent page: https://www.justwatch.com/de/Talent  
 
How to apply:  
 
Show your interest in any way that works for you, we simplified the application process -  send us whatever you have or just your Linkedin and a brief message explaining why you are a great fit for this role.  
 
If you have any questions, please reach out to Daria from our talent team via LinkedIn or apply to this role directly through this listing.

We believe the place where you are born shouldn't determine your opportunities in life. We provide access to global opportunities by offering a world-class education no matter where you come from.
Microverse is an online school for software developers where students learn to work remotely with people from around the world. Students don't pay tuition until they get hired and start a global career. As of today, we have students in 100+ countries, and more than 90% of our alumni get a job within 6 months with an average salary increase of 240% working for companies like Microsoft, and VMWare.
We are backed by amazing investors worldwide, including Y Combinator, Northzone, General Catalyst, and many world-class angel investors, such as Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit (the creator of Gmail), Kevin Hartz (the founder of Eventbrite), and Erica Brescia (Github's COO).
We are a passionate and fast-moving team of global citizens working remotely from 12+ countries. Being remote-first and transparent, we take pride in the amazing remote culture we are building, while also making time for in-person time with team members around the world. We are a small but mighty team of curious, life-long learners, who love tackling challenges and helping shape the future of education.
Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. We're on a mission to change that. With the recent closing of our Series A, there has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team.
Job Description
We are looking for an experienced, hands-on Growth Product Manager (PM) who will be responsible for launching innovative products and experiences to drive growth at Microverse. You’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution of key growth product initiatives initially focused on unlocking remarkable experiences for our applicants and engaging them as students in the Microverse program.
We use No Code tools like Integromat and Zapier to integrate across numerous third-party tools, so we're able to automate workflows and processes outside of traditional software development. We're looking for a scrappy PM interested in getting their hands dirty designing and building prototypes themselves to quickly drive change. Experimenting and iterating will be a big part of your day-to-day work as you strive to achieve your OKRs.
The Growth area will start as a squad of one. Though you'll have access to designers and developers on our Program squad to collaborate with, the right person for this role is excited to ideate, prototype, and launch your own work. The Growth Product Manager will report to the Head of Product & Learning, and day-to-day you'll work with cross-functional team members, particularly with Marketing and Admissions.
We are currently growing our Product Development teams nearly from the ground up. You'll get an opportunity to be a highly impactful member of a fast-growing, mission-driven start-up with ambitious goals and a strong culture of care and collaboration.
While we are highly communicative and collaborative, we are also highly asynchronous and strive to abide by remote-first best practices. You'll send a lot of Loom videos, respond to Twist threads, and have comment conversations on documentation before meetings, so we can all stay off Zoom and maintain our flexible working schedules.
Duties and Responsibilities

Lead a team through the ideation, technical development, and launch of innovative products that drive Growth (initially focused on student acquisition, but open to other growth areas of the company like expanding employer partnerships).
Monitor the market and develop competitive analyses to drive Growth product development strategy.
Actively and compassionately listen to our applicants and develop clear user personas we can use in product discovery and development.
Balance your deep understanding of our user needs with our OKRs and business needs to define a product strategy and prioritize opportunities and requests accordingly.
Evaluate opportunities based on business feasibility, and collaborate with operational teams to ensure cost effectiveness of solutions.
Write product requirements, user stories, and be willing to dive into prototyping and launching Growth products with whatever tool is the best fit, either utilizing current tools we use like Integromat, Zapier, Gather.town, Webflow, etc. or adding a new one to the mix.
Develop products in an iterative way with a focus on MVPs and running experiments to ensure the viability of changes before cementing them into the service.
Perform idea feedback collection from applicants, students, and staff and run a product discovery process to turn it into a refined backlog prioritized for development work, initially by you and later by other designers and developers.
Develop business requirements and specification documents.
Develop KPIs and agile/development metrics for measuring progress at team and feature levels.

Education, Skills, and Experience

5+ years of experience in Growth / Product Management.
Proven track record for driving growth using a variety of models.
Highly structured and analytical thinking.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a track record of effectively prioritizing, communicating, and coordinating efforts across teams.
Highly empathetic toward our users and sensitive to their particular needs.
Experience prototyping and launching using third-party tools and no-code integration solutions (like Integromat).
Again: tools, tools, tools! You know tools, or know there is probably an existing tool out there and are not afraid to find it and add it to our No Code ecosystem if it makes sense to do so.
Excited by defining opportunities and developing solutions.
Love experimenting and following it up with hands-on iteration to drive change quickly.
Ability to conduct qualitative user interviews and quantitative research to explain and validate findings, without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.
Experience taking new product ideas from zero to one; skilled at iterative sprints.
Experience using analytics and data to inform product decisions and measure post-launch impact.
Experience leveraging a wide variety of product-based analytics and a method for balancing instinct and data.
Experience working in a startup (fast-growth environment & technology-focused company).

You Ideally...

Have a background in design that you can bring to designing experiences and workflows to drive growth
Understand the best practices in software development

101,Product Manager,Roadmunk,Canada Only,"Product Manager
ABOUT US
Roadmunk is a privately held, high-growth startup in the rapidly emerging market of Product Management software. Roadmunk was born out of a problem our founders experienced personally: there was no simple way for product managers to collect feedback, surface customer-driven insights and create roadmaps using a single platform. So we went out and built it for ourselves, making sure it was collaborative, beautifully designed and secure. 
Today, we are home to thousands of forward-thinking product teams including those from organizations like Disney, Sonos and Under Armour. 
In the fall of 2019, Roadmunk was 12th in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards for its rapid revenue growth and bold innovation. The Fast 50 program recognizes Canada’s 50 fastest growing technology companies with the highest revenue-growth percentage over the past four years. Roadmunk also ranked 96th on Deloitte’s Technology Fast 500 List for North America.
ROLE SUMMARY
Product Management is the beating heart of Roadmunk. Along with your design and development counterparts (aka triad members) you will not only enable product management teams (our customers) to become more effective but will help shape the future of product management practice.

A Product Manager’s role at Roadmunk has a “meta element” because your expertise and skills will have a direct impact on the product management practice at our customers’ organizations. The product management team at Roadmunk is small, fast growing, and composed of seasoned professionals from a diverse set of product backgrounds. Our market opportunity is massive in scale and with a fast growing company like ours, offers unparalleled growth opportunities for Product Managers.
Key responsibilities

Ability to work in a highly collaborative environment while surrounded by chaos and ambiguity
Experience using data to inform decisions while still having a high degree of bias for action
Ability to put yourself in our customers’ shoes and have deep customer empathy
Curiosity and enthusiasm to continuously learn and improve, and the humility to ask for help when needed
Demonstrable experience defining success metrics for your products/features and managing against them
A track record of numerous failures and the learnings you derived from them

BENEFITS:
Roadmunk has a vibrant, highly engaged culture that has continued even as we work remotely during these difficult times. While the in-office perks such as on-site drinks and snacks, monthly team social events, and the occasional visit from some four-legged colleagues have been temporarily put on hold, our culture of innovation, teamwork, balance and diversity continues as strong as ever. Here’s what you can expect...

3,Technical Writer,Convictional,North America Only,"We’re Convictional. We are building a modern B2B trade network. 
 
Each year, trillions of dollars worth of B2B trade is transacted using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). EDI is difficult for modern businesses to work with. Convictional is changing that. 
 
Our Supplier Enablement Platform enables retailers and marketplaces to onboard, integrate, and transact with all of their suppliers. Convictional's API-driven infrastructure is used by large retailers like Staples, Indigo, Harry Rosen, and Equinox, and brands like Caraway, Detox Market, and Therabody. We recently raised a Series A financing to scale our impact to even more companies.
 
Convictional's platform is informed by thousands of hours of customer consultation and a deep appreciation for both the buyer and seller perspectives. We are continuing to learn about the massive value to be unlocked from all types of B2B trade, including marketplace, dropship and wholesale. We’re aiming at theoretical maximums, not feature-completeness, and intend to bring as many businesses along with us as we can.
 
Taking a new approach to an old problem is nothing special. Our team, and how we engage with each other, is. We are proud to be building a home for kind nerds who want to impact global trade. Our team is strengthened when we take a learning-first approach and seek out opportunities to debate the best customer-focused solutions. We value self-awareness and feel compelled to fully explore the hard questions. 
 
We are a fully distributed team with people located across Canada and the US. We encourage you to design your work schedule and environment so they’re optimal for you. We use email, not Slack. We default to no internal meetings and Deep Work Wednesdays. We expect you to go to coaching or therapy at least occasionally and adhere to 10% compound time.
 
We are inspired every day by the opportunity to pioneer infrastructure that will move trillions of dollars worth of B2B trade. We welcome those who want to join us.

We love our values
We’re building a fam, our chosen circle, around a set of values that guide how we work and interact with the world around us. Our cultural norms at work can’t be turned off when the computer’s away -- we live these in every part of our lives. Our team isn’t for everyone, so if you’re right for it, the following values should resonate strongly with how you live your life.

We’re intolerant to bad vibes, and genuinely love where we work (and want to keep it that way). We choose our fam by looking beyond a skillset - because roles can change - and surround ourselves with folks we want to spend our lives with.

We aim high and hire smart people to get there -- folks that use logic and critical thinking to make the best decisions. We look beyond the problem and quickly build context to come to the right solution; our ever-changing and high-pace environment requires a team of great autonomous thinkers. 

When we say “got it,” our team knows we’re owning it, we’re following through, and we’ll deliver beyond expectations. Put the effort into figuring things out yourself (hey, we’re all busy), and actively collaborate if you haven’t Got it; ownership also means knowing when to seek help and to never suffer in silence.

We’re a rare team of folks that genuinely love to work hard because we know that putting in the effort gets the win -- we’re the people that started our careers at the lemonade stand. Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle’s more fun when we’re winning together.

We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they’re pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There’s no hesitation in being direct; since we’re surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.

Our problem-focused teams allow for regular innovation, which we foster further with workshops and hack-days, building things like study debriefing tools and experiments comparing our platform to competitors like MTurk.
 
Continuous learning and development is strongly encouraged. Everyone gets a personal development budget which they can put towards things like books, courses and conferences, and reserve times every fortnight for learning new things or working on creative side-projects.
 
We’re aware of the challenges of being a remote worker and work hard to foster team-spirit. We encourage remote chats over coffee with colleagues and have regular team meetings to keep everyone up to date with goings on across the company and introduce new joiners.
 
We believe that we are in the process of successfully building a company that people enjoy working for. Our employees should feel valued, supported, and fulfilled. We know that there’s always more that we could be doing and have regular conversations about what we can improve. Everyone’s opinion is important and all input is taken on board.

32,Deputy Chief Technology Officer,Colorofchange,USA Only,"ABOUT COLOR OF CHANGE
Color Of Change is one of the largest Black-led racial justice organizations in the country with more than 7 million email and SMS subscribers. We specialize in providing our members with easy, strategic actions to take in response to racial injustices - that when added with the voices of others - create the leverage for winning real-world change for Black people. From our work to replace district attorneys unwilling to punish violent police officers to pushing back against Silicon Valley enablers of white supremacists, Color Of Change has a track record of holding decision-makers - corporate and political - accountable to Black people.
ROLE SUMMARY
There has never been a more exciting time to work on technology at Color Of Change: the organization has been making deep investments in technology and data, including the recent hire of the organization’s first executive-level CTO. This scaling process includes the addition of new skill functions, including designers, product managers, engineers, and more to boost the overall capabilities of the team. We are creating cross-functional technology teams that build the software and data intelligence products needed to help our work reach the next level of impact.
With this increased capacity comes increased complexity. Due to time constraints and prioritization, the CTO will not be able to touch all the critical department functions and needs a partner in the running of the technology team.
KEY OBJECTIVES
The CTO will delegate important functions to her deputy so that she is able to focus on areas where she is uniquely equipped to lead. While the ultimate split of team responsibilities will depend on the profile of the hired candidate, we expect that the Deputy role will have day-to-day ownership of several key areas:
Team performance management

Hiring, including drafting job descriptions and engaging with the internal HR team, and when necessary, external recruiters
Goal-setting processes, both at the team and individual levels
Ensuring quality management practices across the team, including strong 1:1s, performance reviews, and related processes
Taking the lead on HR processes for the team

Team coordination and communication

Ownership of team meetings, including agenda development, facilitation, and post-meeting follow-through
Champion best practices in internal communication across our collaboration platforms (Asana, Slack, etc.)
Work closely with the CTO to ensure important organization information is regularly shared with the team, and that important team information is regularly shared with the organization

Vendor management

Regularly review our vendor contracts to make sure we are getting what we need, and not paying for services we no longer use
Negotiate contracts with a resource stewardship mentality

Budgeting & Financial Management

Draft team budgets in coordination with team members
Work with the Finance team on reviewing budget-to-actuals and making adjustments as needed

Discrete Projects

Lead specific projects for which there is no clear natural owner, or when team capacity is stretched


Support the CTO as necessary

QUALIFICATIONS
We are looking for a creative and mature leader with vision and insight, recognizing that person could come from a range of backgrounds.
Some or all of these would be great to see in the ideal candidate’s background:

Experienced manager who understands what it takes to successfully run a complex team and navigate the accompanying people dynamics
An excellent project manager who can keep the trains running on time
Ready to wear many hats and do what it takes to support the CTO and ensure the team is successful
Demonstrated alignment with Color Of Change’s mission, and a strong commitment to racial and/or social justice
Budget management experience 
Experience working with cross-functional teams
Strong facilitation, prioritization, and influencing skills
Demonstrated experience and skills in running a remote, virtual team, including preparing for and running good virtual meetings
Experience and skill with collaboration tools like Asana, Slack, Miro, and others in order to help the team create strong internal processes
An ownership mentality
Willingness to engage with and execute on a plan, even in situations you may disagree on some of the elements
Orchestrate collaboration by removing roadblocks and fostering communication
Experience prioritizing competing demands
Demonstrated ability to manage and resolve conflict
Excellent written and verbal communication skills with a willingness to give (and receive) feedback.

World Tour are the top 2 trivia games, engaging millions of global players every month. In 2020, Uken released Ava’s Manor, a solitaire game where users renovate and decorate the manor while discovering mysterious clues and dabbling in a romantic love story. Uken’s foray into narrative games is an exciting opportunity for the company. 
 
We consider our Ukenites to be data-driven designers, technologists, and artists. Through collaboration, we pair the craft of design with feedback and data to deliver a pace and rhythm in each game session that immerses our audience and engages them for years. We have a quirky, nerdy culture that fosters creativity, collaboration, quality ideas, innovation, and a data-driven mindset. We believe in moving quickly and improving constantly and that mantra is reflected in the weekly updates we make to our games and internal technologies. We have an appetite for pushing technical boundaries but with a focus on practical use.
 
We maintain our presence within the tech community by running and hosting numerous technical events and meetups. Our commitment to Engineering and Technology is also seen in our service-oriented architecture with well-modularized responsibilities that allow us to build, maintain and scale our applications. We use both blocking and asynchronous non-blocking programming models when advantageous to do so. Our dozens of game services are built to scale beyond a million DAU while maintaining an average of single-digit millisecond response times. We use a diverse set of both NoSQL and traditional relational databases (e.g.: Aurora, Cassandra, Redis, Redshift), modern JVM (Java and Scala) frameworks, and programming methods. We have a deep understanding of the AWS cloud where we've been running all our infrastructure for almost a decade.
 
At Uken, we believe that understanding data is a fundamental skill and when leveraged well, it can be used to elevate even the best-designed products. This is why we’re thrilled to be adding a Data Engineer to our Platform team. We are looking for someone to work alongside our engineers, product and project managers to improve and maintain the integrity of our data systems which are responsible for transforming the millions of raw logs we capture each day into actionable insights used by everybody in the company. These actionable insights are foundational to improving the user experience in our games in a meaningful way. This role is intended for a candidate with a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals.  
 
As a Ukenite, you'll be working on meaningful things like:

Acquiring a complete understanding of how data moves and is transformed across our systems from raw event logs to critical reports consumed by internal teams
Creating and maintaining optimal data pipelines within our architecture
Building jobs and tools on top of the data pipeline to provide actionable insights into key metrics
Debugging discrepancy issues that come up in the ETL (e.g. misaligned metrics with 3rd parties, duplicates, failures in the ETL, performance bottlenecks)
Building tools to automate data verification and ensure the integrity of our reported metrics
Integrating data from multiple sources across internal and external partners
Working alongside Data Engineers and Project Managers to strive for greater functionality in our data systems

 
Your background should include:

Experience with object-oriented, functional, and scripting languages e.g.: Scala, Python, Java
SQL skills
Experience with relational SQL and NoSQL databases such as including Redshift, Postgres, Redis, and MySQL
Experience with tools used for large scale data processing: Spark, Hadoop, Kafka
Experience with cloud services such as Amazon AWS 

 
It'd be a big plus if you have:

Knowledge of message queuing, stream processing, and highly scalable ‘big data’ technologies
Understanding of the different federated querying, data warehousing, and BI technologies and how they work together to form a Data Platform.
Knowledge of Machine Learning and experience implementing ML applications
Worked with real-time and streaming analytics
Experience building tech that operates at scale
Contributed to an Open Source Project

 
What's in it for you?

You’ll be equipped with a high-end PC or laptop 
Competitive compensation and benefits
Fully catered lunch, breakfast, and a snack filled kitchen (in-office)
Uken social nights including mixers, game night, and more - we take entertainment seriously!
Office-based or home-based work options 
Convenient location in the heart of downtown Toronto at Front & John St. 

 
At Uken, we believe there is power in diversity and strive for a diverse, inclusive, and accessible environment. Our ongoing innovative journey relies on each Ukenite to be different. All qualified applicants will be assessed equally regardless of race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, age, sex, sexual attraction, gender identity, or expression, and would not face discrimination based on disability.

If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test! Important: our test has nothing to do with Rebellion Pay—we do not ask you to do any feature or solve a problem of our app. You have 1 week to solve this test. You can upload it to a repository and pass the test to our Engineering team so they can review it.


Finally, we invite you to the last Hangout—the test review, again with our CTO and CPO. It is important here that your test is working correctly so that everything goes as well as possible and you can be calm and confident during the test review.


Hope to see you here soon!

Our recruitment process in a nutshell


After receiving your application, you will have a first Hangout with our People Manager if your profile goes through our first screening. It will be an easy-going conversation where our People Manager will tell you a little more about Rebellion Pay as a company and our culture and growth, and you will be given more details about the team which you can be part of.


If the interview with our People Manager goes well, we will invite you to a second Hangout with our CTO and CPO. Here they will explain to you better our product and technological stack, our features, and here is where you can also clarify any more technical questions—take advantage of it!


If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test! Important: our test has nothing to do with Rebellion Pay—we do not ask you to do any feature or solve a problem of our app. You have 1 week to solve this test. You can upload it to a repository and pass the test to our Engineering team so they can review it.


Finally, we invite you to the last Hangout—the test review, again with our CTO and CPO. It is important here that your test is working correctly so that everything goes as well as possible and you can be calm and confident during the test review.


Hope to see you here soon!

63,Front-end Engineer,surefoot,USA Only,"hi there, thanks for stopping by.
What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply.
what we do
We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in:

user experience research and design
full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)
data analytics
email

about your role and team
If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!
As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav – the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.
Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time – both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, “do the bare minimum”, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with “that's not in my job description” attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.
Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your “weird” show every once in awhile.
We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply. Now.
a day in the life of a front-end engineer

start your morning with a cup o' joe and fire up your computer to check emails, Slack and Asana.
it's 10:30am CST, time for our team Zoom stand-up to chit chat with teammates a bit, then talk through your priorities for the day and any blockers.
shortly after stand-up, you begin working on the big test in your queue – a navigation redesign for mobile and desktop devices.
once you've added the necessary events and configured the test in the testing tool, you'll pass it off to QA and take a break to refill your coffee or participate in some witty banter (complete with GIFs and custom emojis) in #watercooler.
as the day nears it's end, you'll patch a few bugs identified in QA, send the test to the strategic director for review and answer a few questions in Asana from your teammates about test details.
it's the first Wednesday of the month, so grab your beverage of choice and wrap up the day with the team at a Zoom virtual happy hour!

ready to apply?
Since we are a fully remote team, we have a somewhat atypical interview process. For the first step of the interview phase, we ask applicants to show basic competency in the necessary skill sets (don't worry, no hazing a la “live code fizzbuzz” is involved).
If all is well there, you'll move on to phase two which involves a Zoom video call to get to know one another a bit better. If we're feeling good about that, we'll contact your references.
And finally, if your references check out and confirm you're not a stabber, we'll ask you to do some actual paid work with us to determine fit for both parties.
To apply, please fill out our application form and be ready to submit a link to your code from this exercise.
 
----------
All applicants will receive a response. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds foster a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better business results. We strive to create workplaces that reflect the clients we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work. We are an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are also committed to working with candidates from all ability levels throughout the recruitment process to ensure they have what they need to be at their best.

71,Finance Administrator,Empire Flippers LLC,Anywhere,"The Details to Keep in Mind
 
Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire right away.
When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work and teach you about each department within the business. 
As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into the low-level tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later becoming an independent fully fledged Finance Administrator for Empire Flippers.
It’s important to stress How We Work – which is from anywhere in the world. We are results driven and completely remote (pre-pandemic even), which for us equals total freedom! 
If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.
 
Love it. What’s the Catch?
 
We love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.
A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.
Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. 
Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer’s questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.
A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.
We focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. 
We’re made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this Finance Administrator position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.
 
What Skills Are Needed? 
 
We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.
You must have experience or training. We are looking for a skilled finance administrator with at least some experience/training in an accounting or finance role. The ideal candidate will use their experience to help create and make improvements to our financial processes. 
Numbers are your second language – Regardless of your experience, you will need to love numbers to excel at this role. We are looking for someone who lives and thrives in a spreadsheet. You will need to be diligent with figures and have that reflected in your work. 
You’re a confident and proactive self-starter. You will face obstacles and challenges. A buyer might be late on their earnout payment and you will need to chase them. An affiliate dashboard may not generate the reports we need and you will need to follow up with their support team. It will be down to you to manage that process and ensure everything is nicely kept up. 
Technical experience. To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 
You’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.
 
What’s the Finance Administrator Position Like? 
 
While we are an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not overly corporate. You’ll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.
It has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us. 
When you first come on board as a Finance Administrator, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company.  
You will become well versed in all of our finance processes, from how to reconcile the inventory of an eCommerce business to pulling revenue data from various affiliate dashboards. 
Once you have the basics down, we would love to lean on your accountancy background and make improvements to the current processes we have in place. No one in the team is tied to our processes and we actively encourage improvement across the board. 
You might be wondering, though … what does your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?
 
Here is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):
 

Reviewing the inventory levels of eCommerce businesses and creating spreadsheets of the total cost price inventory dollar amount. 
Running revenue reports for affiliate sites and calculating the net revenue due to both buyer and seller.  
Work with buyers and sellers to review these reconciliation amounts and answer any questions they have on the numbers. 
Work closely with other Migration team members to aid them with any specific reconciliation/accountancy work that needs to be completed on the deals they are managing
Work closely with the Migration Supervisor to improve our current reconciliation processes. 
Follow up with buyers for any payments due on deals that include an earnout. This typically means emailing/calling the buyer a few days before payment is due and also chasing if not paid.  
Review deals with a performance-related earnout to calculate the amount due to the seller. This typically means reviewing P&Ls/revenue reports to calculate whether or not a business has reached a certain benchmark over the selected time period.  
You will eventually take full responsibility for managing all of the earnouts included in our deals. 
Track and forecast different metrics related to earnouts. 

Ultimately, you’ll help our team grow and thrive by handling the numbers side of the migration process. 
 
What is a Finance Administrator for the Migration Team? 
 
The role will work closely with the supervisor and individual team members to carry out various financial tasks related to the process of buying/selling a business. 
You will also be responsible for reviewing and managing all of our earnouts and earnout processes. We currently have roughly 80 active earnouts in progress at any one time. In 2021, earnouts will also account for nearly 15% of our overall net fees target, meaning this role will have a direct impact on our bottom line. 
The ideal candidate will be extremely numbers-oriented and will have experience directly relating to financial/inventory reconciliation or management. The new hire will be our ‘go-to numbers person’ in the team and will help us to sharpen up our processes across the board.
We are looking to bring on a talented professional to join our Migration Department in the role of Finance Administrator. Training will commence at the start of January and run approximately 8-12 weeks. 
While the Migration team works during business hours in multiple time zones, the role itself is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world (*see USA resident requirements below). Be it the beaches in Mexico or in a mountain resort in the Swiss Alps – the choice is yours. 
This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth, and there is no sign of it slowing down. 
In order to keep hitting our goals, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying, selling, and investing in online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before. 
Are you ready to get started?
If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position.
 
What’s the Opportunity? 
 
Becoming a Finance Administrator makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers. 
You will represent our brand by working with buyers/sellers and promoting Empire Flipper’s company reputation as a great place to buy/sell a business while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. 
Your work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. You should have at least some direct experience or training in an accountancy role.
If you’re a strong numbers person and comfortable with various accountancy practices, we’d like to meet you.
Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours.
We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. 
We are going to rely on your experience to make our earnout process better and smoother for our customers and team. 
When you first start off, you will be training with our Migration Supervisor and other senior migration team members for 8-12 weeks. We typically meet in person during this time, but due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, we are assessing travel requirements during this process and will know more as the hire date gets closer.
Speaking of travel, our company holds bi-annual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building – we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. We are planning another meetup in the last quarter of 2022 (location TBD). So dust off your passport, and we’ll aim to see you then! 
For the first six months, you will be paid $2,700 USD per month during the probation period. After six months, you will be introduced to our compensation plan where you will earn a base pay of $3,000 USD per month plus a performance-based bonus. 
Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage. We also offer equity stake in the company.

87,Lead Golang Engineer,JustWatch GmbH,Anywhere,"The Marketing Technology team is the most important part of the B2B side of JustWatch. We are the first fully Movie & TV show entertainment-centred marketing platform worldwide and had to build our tools from scratch. Our custom-built marketing platform allows our campaigns team to execute a volume of campaigns that, if done manually, would require a much bigger team.
 
Some of the topics we have recently worked on are:
- adding different advertising channels with their various API quirks
- expanding our system to cover new workflows as required by evolving campaign requirements
- and (as usual) eliminating bugs
 
The biggest challenge now is utilizing ML and algorithms to run campaigns with ridiculous efficiency and much better targeting.
 
Our stack
 
The marketing stack is based on services written in Golang, running in Kubernetes managed by Google Cloud Platform. We store data in PostgreSQL and monitor everything through Prometheus.
We use several advertising channels (and their APIs) such as Facebook and Google, and help our BI team to build relevant reports using a data warehouse based on Snowflake.
 
How we work, and what’s in it for you

Freedom and responsibility


We share context on what matters to the business. The delivery is up to you. That also means we don’t track vacation days, have flexible working hours, and allow working remotely


No company-wide Scrum or other enforced processes. We are agile without the artificial overhead


Great colleagues and a creative environment


We prefer asking forgiveness than asking for permission


Direct communication, no bloated hierarchy


Frequent open, honest and bi-directional feedback


What we expect from you

We are interested in the value you can bring rather than years of experience, the knowledge of every piece of our tech stack or well-curated references. Do you have a side project? Have you failed or succeeded at your own startup? Are you an expert in a piece of our stack?  Incredibly driven? Entrepreneurial? These are the achievements and traits we're interested in.

 
As a guideline for technology and skills

Experience as a backend engineer, deep familiarity with Go (Golang) language.


Advanced ability to work with relational databases, preferably Postgres.


Domain experience with DMPs, DSPs or within the AdTech/marketing tech ecosystem.


Experience leading a backend engineering team.

If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.   
 
The job can be fully remote or hybrid (our office is in Berlin and if you decide to relocate - we will fully support it)
 
We embrace our entrepreneurial responsibilities. Through our 6-figure environmental and social impact budget, we offset every employee’s carbon footprint, give back to the community, support causes that matter, and have recently implemented a wellbeing and mental health programme. 
 
Read more about our culture in our blog post and Talent page: https://www.justwatch.com/de/Talent  
 
How to apply:  
 
Show your interest in any way that works for you, we simplified the application process -  send us whatever you have or just your Linkedin and a brief message explaining why you are a great fit for this role.  
 
If you have any questions, please reach out to Daria from our talent team via LinkedIn or apply to this role directly through this listing.

About Microverse
We believe the place where you are born shouldn't determine your opportunities in life. We provide access to global opportunities by offering a world-class education no matter where you come from.
Microverse is an online school for software developers where students learn to work remotely with people from around the world. Students don't pay tuition until they get hired and start a global career. As of today, we have students in 100+ countries, and more than 90% of our alumni get a job within 6 months with an average salary increase of 240% working for companies like Microsoft, and VMWare.
We are backed by amazing investors worldwide, including Y Combinator, Northzone, General Catalyst, and many world-class angel investors, such as Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit (the creator of Gmail), Kevin Hartz (the founder of Eventbrite), and Erica Brescia (Github's COO).
We are a passionate and fast-moving team of global citizens working remotely from 12+ countries. Being remote-first and transparent, we take pride in the amazing remote culture we are building, while also making time for in-person time with team members around the world. We are a small but mighty team of curious, life-long learners, who love tackling challenges and helping shape the future of education.
Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. We're on a mission to change that. With the recent closing of our Series A, there has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team.
Job Description
We are looking for an experienced, hands-on Growth Product Manager (PM) who will be responsible for launching innovative products and experiences to drive growth at Microverse. You’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution of key growth product initiatives initially focused on unlocking remarkable experiences for our applicants and engaging them as students in the Microverse program.
We use No Code tools like Integromat and Zapier to integrate across numerous third-party tools, so we're able to automate workflows and processes outside of traditional software development. We're looking for a scrappy PM interested in getting their hands dirty designing and building prototypes themselves to quickly drive change. Experimenting and iterating will be a big part of your day-to-day work as you strive to achieve your OKRs.
The Growth area will start as a squad of one. Though you'll have access to designers and developers on our Program squad to collaborate with, the right person for this role is excited to ideate, prototype, and launch your own work. The Growth Product Manager will report to the Head of Product & Learning, and day-to-day you'll work with cross-functional team members, particularly with Marketing and Admissions.
We are currently growing our Product Development teams nearly from the ground up. You'll get an opportunity to be a highly impactful member of a fast-growing, mission-driven start-up with ambitious goals and a strong culture of care and collaboration.
While we are highly communicative and collaborative, we are also highly asynchronous and strive to abide by remote-first best practices. You'll send a lot of Loom videos, respond to Twist threads, and have comment conversations on documentation before meetings, so we can all stay off Zoom and maintain our flexible working schedules.
Duties and Responsibilities

Lead a team through the ideation, technical development, and launch of innovative products that drive Growth (initially focused on student acquisition, but open to other growth areas of the company like expanding employer partnerships).
Monitor the market and develop competitive analyses to drive Growth product development strategy.
Actively and compassionately listen to our applicants and develop clear user personas we can use in product discovery and development.
Balance your deep understanding of our user needs with our OKRs and business needs to define a product strategy and prioritize opportunities and requests accordingly.
Evaluate opportunities based on business feasibility, and collaborate with operational teams to ensure cost effectiveness of solutions.
Write product requirements, user stories, and be willing to dive into prototyping and launching Growth products with whatever tool is the best fit, either utilizing current tools we use like Integromat, Zapier, Gather.town, Webflow, etc. or adding a new one to the mix.
Develop products in an iterative way with a focus on MVPs and running experiments to ensure the viability of changes before cementing them into the service.
Perform idea feedback collection from applicants, students, and staff and run a product discovery process to turn it into a refined backlog prioritized for development work, initially by you and later by other designers and developers.
Develop business requirements and specification documents.
Develop KPIs and agile/development metrics for measuring progress at team and feature levels.

Education, Skills, and Experience

5+ years of experience in Growth / Product Management.
Proven track record for driving growth using a variety of models.
Highly structured and analytical thinking.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a track record of effectively prioritizing, communicating, and coordinating efforts across teams.
Highly empathetic toward our users and sensitive to their particular needs.
Experience prototyping and launching using third-party tools and no-code integration solutions (like Integromat).
Again: tools, tools, tools! You know tools, or know there is probably an existing tool out there and are not afraid to find it and add it to our No Code ecosystem if it makes sense to do so.
Excited by defining opportunities and developing solutions.
Love experimenting and following it up with hands-on iteration to drive change quickly.
Ability to conduct qualitative user interviews and quantitative research to explain and validate findings, without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.
Experience taking new product ideas from zero to one; skilled at iterative sprints.
Experience using analytics and data to inform product decisions and measure post-launch impact.
Experience leveraging a wide variety of product-based analytics and a method for balancing instinct and data.
Experience working in a startup (fast-growth environment & technology-focused company).

You Ideally...

Roadmunk is a privately held, high-growth startup in the rapidly emerging market of Product Management software. Roadmunk was born out of a problem our founders experienced personally: there was no simple way for product managers to collect feedback, surface customer-driven insights and create roadmaps using a single platform. So we went out and built it for ourselves, making sure it was collaborative, beautifully designed and secure. 
Today, we are home to thousands of forward-thinking product teams including those from organizations like Disney, Sonos and Under Armour. 
In the fall of 2019, Roadmunk was 12th in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards for its rapid revenue growth and bold innovation.

We love our values
We’re building a fam, our chosen circle, around a set of values that guide how we work and interact with the world around us. Our cultural norms at work can’t be turned off when the computer’s away -- we live these in every part of our lives. Our team isn’t for everyone, so if you’re right for it, the following values should resonate strongly with how you live your life.

We’re intolerant to bad vibes, and genuinely love where we work (and want to keep it that way). We choose our fam by looking beyond a skillset - because roles can change - and surround ourselves with folks we want to spend our lives with.

We aim high and hire smart people to get there -- folks that use logic and critical thinking to make the best decisions. We look beyond the problem and quickly build context to come to the right solution; our ever-changing and high-pace environment requires a team of great autonomous thinkers. 

When we say “got it,” our team knows we’re owning it, we’re following through, and we’ll deliver beyond expectations. Put the effort into figuring things out yourself (hey, we’re all busy), and actively collaborate if you haven’t Got it; ownership also means knowing when to seek help and to never suffer in silence.

We’re a rare team of folks that genuinely love to work hard because we know that putting in the effort gets the win -- we’re the people that started our careers at the lemonade stand. Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle’s more fun when we’re winning together.

We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they’re pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There’s no hesitation in being direct; since we’re surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.

£75-110K depending on skills and experience
 
 
The Role
 
We're looking for an experienced Senior DevOps Engineer. In this role you will play a key role in developing and guiding the direction of our infrastructure. Being a young startup, we have built up a certain level of infrastructure already but now we need to prepare it for scaling (both of our users and of our team). This is close to a green field opportunity: you’ll get to decide what our infrastructure should look like, all the while supporting our existing teams with ongoing product development. We want our DevOps team to be able to work closely together, as well as integrate within other teams when the need arises.
 
You should have broad practical knowledge as well as some experience leading other engineers in your domain.
 
 
How we Operate
 
Our engineers are split into small multi-discipline teams of 3-7 people (engineers, product designers, UX, product managers). These teams are problem-focused and work on high level objectives. Each team use 6-12 week cycles to meet the objectives with continuous delivery throughout the cycle.
 
We have a strong belief in the value of testing - both integration and unit testing. All code goes through code review.
 
Deep work is valued throughout the company. We favour async communication over Slack and Notion. When we need to communicate in real-time we try to group meetings together to give everyone bigger blocks of interruption-free time.
 
Our problem-focused teams allow for regular innovation, which we foster further with workshops and hack-days, building things like study debriefing tools and experiments comparing our platform to competitors like MTurk.
 
Continuous learning and development is strongly encouraged. Everyone gets a personal development budget which they can put towards things like books, courses and conferences, and reserve times every fortnight for learning new things or working on creative side-projects.
 
We’re aware of the challenges of being a remote worker and work hard to foster team-spirit. We encourage remote chats over coffee with colleagues and have regular team meetings to keep everyone up to date with goings on across the company and introduce new joiners.
 
We believe that we are in the process of successfully building a company that people enjoy working for. Our employees should feel valued, supported, and fulfilled. We know that there’s always more that we could be doing and have regular conversations about what we can improve. Everyone’s opinion is important and all input is taken on board.
 

What you'll be doing

Assessing our current infrastructure and working with the engineering team to establish what needs to change.


Leading your team to implement infrastructure changes.


Monitoring the platform's usage and flagging scaling issues before they occur.

Experience of building and scaling infrastructure for web applications or platforms


Experience managing systems in a cloud environment


Experience leading other engineers on DevOps topics


Experience of running Kubernetes in Production

Fun and collaborative quarterly company-wide meet-ups and team socials paid for by us.

Childcare flexibility: Need to pick your child up from school? No problem.


Generous maternity, paternity, and shared parental leave.


A company committed to carbon offsetting: we donate money in your name each month to plant trees and we offset travel as an organisation each year.

We specialize in providing our members with easy, strategic actions to take in response to racial injustices - that when added with the voices of others - create the leverage for winning real-world change for Black people. From our work to replace district attorneys unwilling to punish violent police officers to pushing back against Silicon Valley enablers of white supremacists, Color Of Change has a track record of holding decision-makers - corporate and political - accountable to Black people.
ROLE SUMMARY
There has never been a more exciting time to work on technology at Color Of Change: the organization has been making deep investments in technology and data, including the recent hire of the organization’s first executive-level CTO. This scaling process includes the addition of new skill functions, including designers, product managers, engineers, and more to boost the overall capabilities of the team. We are creating cross-functional technology teams that build the software and data intelligence products needed to help our work reach the next level of impact.
With this increased capacity comes increased complexity. Due to time constraints and prioritization, the CTO will not be able to touch all the critical department functions and needs a partner in the running of the technology team.
KEY OBJECTIVES
The CTO will delegate important functions to her deputy so that she is able to focus on areas where she is uniquely equipped to lead. While the ultimate split of team responsibilities will depend on the profile of the hired candidate, we expect that the Deputy role will have day-to-day ownership of several key areas:
Team performance management

Goal-setting processes, both at the team and individual levels
Ensuring quality management practices across the team, including strong 1:1s, performance reviews, and related processes
Taking the lead on HR processes for the team

Team coordination and communication

Ownership of team meetings, including agenda development, facilitation, and post-meeting follow-through
Champion best practices in internal communication across our collaboration platforms (Asana, Slack, etc.)
Work closely with the CTO to ensure important organization information is regularly shared with the team, and that important team information is regularly shared with the organization

Vendor management

Regularly review our vendor contracts to make sure we are getting what we need, and not paying for services we no longer use
Negotiate contracts with a resource stewardship mentality

Budgeting & Financial Management

Draft team budgets in coordination with team members
Work with the Finance team on reviewing budget-to-actuals and making adjustments as needed

Discrete Projects

Lead specific projects for which there is no clear natural owner, or when team capacity is stretched


Support the CTO as necessary

QUALIFICATIONS
We are looking for a creative and mature leader with vision and insight, recognizing that person could come from a range of backgrounds.
Some or all of these would be great to see in the ideal candidate’s background:

Experienced manager who understands what it takes to successfully run a complex team and navigate the accompanying people dynamics
An excellent project manager who can keep the trains running on time
Ready to wear many hats and do what it takes to support the CTO and ensure the team is successful
Demonstrated alignment with Color Of Change’s mission, and a strong commitment to racial and/or social justice
Budget management experience 
Experience working with cross-functional teams
Strong facilitation, prioritization, and influencing skills
Demonstrated experience and skills in running a remote, virtual team, including preparing for and running good virtual meetings
Experience and skill with collaboration tools like Asana, Slack, Miro, and others in order to help the team create strong internal processes
An ownership mentality
Willingness to engage with and execute on a plan, even in situations you may disagree on some of the elements
Orchestrate collaboration by removing roadblocks and fostering communication
Experience prioritizing competing demands
Demonstrated ability to manage and resolve conflict
Excellent written and verbal communication skills with a willingness to give (and receive) feedback.

Building tools to automate data verification and ensure the integrity of our reported metrics
Integrating data from multiple sources across internal and external partners
Working alongside Data Engineers and Project Managers to strive for greater functionality in our data systems

If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test!

63,Front-end Engineer,surefoot,USA Only,"hi there, thanks for stopping by.
What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply.
what we do
We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in:

user experience research and design
full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)
data analytics
email

about your role and team
If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!
As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav – the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.
Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time – both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, “do the bare minimum”, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with “that's not in my job description” attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.
Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your “weird” show every once in awhile.
We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply. Now.
a day in the life of a front-end engineer

start your morning with a cup o' joe and fire up your computer to check emails, Slack and Asana.
it's 10:30am CST, time for our team Zoom stand-up to chit chat with teammates a bit, then talk through your priorities for the day and any blockers.
shortly after stand-up, you begin working on the big test in your queue – a navigation redesign for mobile and desktop devices.
once you've added the necessary events and configured the test in the testing tool, you'll pass it off to QA and take a break to refill your coffee or participate in some witty banter (complete with GIFs and custom emojis) in #watercooler.
as the day nears it's end, you'll patch a few bugs identified in QA, send the test to the strategic director for review and answer a few questions in Asana from your teammates about test details.
it's the first Wednesday of the month, so grab your beverage of choice and wrap up the day with the team at a Zoom virtual happy hour!

71,Finance Administrator,Empire Flippers LLC,Anywhere,"The Details to Keep in Mind
 
Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire right away.
When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work and teach you about each department within the business. 
As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into the low-level tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later becoming an independent fully fledged Finance Administrator for Empire Flippers.
It’s important to stress How We Work – which is from anywhere in the world. We are results driven and completely remote (pre-pandemic even), which for us equals total freedom! 
If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.
 
Love it. What’s the Catch?
 
We love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.
A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.
Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. 
Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer’s questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.
A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.
We focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. 
We’re made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this Finance Administrator position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.
 
What Skills Are Needed? 
 
We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.
You must have experience or training. We are looking for a skilled finance administrator with at least some experience/training in an accounting or finance role. The ideal candidate will use their experience to help create and make improvements to our financial processes. 
Numbers are your second language – Regardless of your experience, you will need to love numbers to excel at this role. We are looking for someone who lives and thrives in a spreadsheet. You will need to be diligent with figures and have that reflected in your work. 
You’re a confident and proactive self-starter. You will face obstacles and challenges. A buyer might be late on their earnout payment and you will need to chase them. An affiliate dashboard may not generate the reports we need and you will need to follow up with their support team. It will be down to you to manage that process and ensure everything is nicely kept up. 
Technical experience. To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 
You’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.
 
What’s the Finance Administrator Position Like? 
 
While we are an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not overly corporate. You’ll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.
It has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us. 
When you first come on board as a Finance Administrator, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company.  
You will become well versed in all of our finance processes, from how to reconcile the inventory of an eCommerce business to pulling revenue data from various affiliate dashboards. 
Once you have the basics down, we would love to lean on your accountancy background and make improvements to the current processes we have in place. No one in the team is tied to our processes and we actively encourage improvement across the board. 
You might be wondering, though … what does your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?
 
Here is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):
 

Reviewing the inventory levels of eCommerce businesses and creating spreadsheets of the total cost price inventory dollar amount. 
Running revenue reports for affiliate sites and calculating the net revenue due to both buyer and seller.  
Work with buyers and sellers to review these reconciliation amounts and answer any questions they have on the numbers. 
Work closely with other Migration team members to aid them with any specific reconciliation/accountancy work that needs to be completed on the deals they are managing
Work closely with the Migration Supervisor to improve our current reconciliation processes. 
Follow up with buyers for any payments due on deals that include an earnout. This typically means emailing/calling the buyer a few days before payment is due and also chasing if not paid.  
Review deals with a performance-related earnout to calculate the amount due to the seller. This typically means reviewing P&Ls/revenue reports to calculate whether or not a business has reached a certain benchmark over the selected time period.  
You will eventually take full responsibility for managing all of the earnouts included in our deals. 
Track and forecast different metrics related to earnouts. 

Ultimately, you’ll help our team grow and thrive by handling the numbers side of the migration process. 
 
What is a Finance Administrator for the Migration Team? 
 
The role will work closely with the supervisor and individual team members to carry out various financial tasks related to the process of buying/selling a business. 
You will also be responsible for reviewing and managing all of our earnouts and earnout processes. We currently have roughly 80 active earnouts in progress at any one time. In 2021, earnouts will also account for nearly 15% of our overall net fees target, meaning this role will have a direct impact on our bottom line. 
The ideal candidate will be extremely numbers-oriented and will have experience directly relating to financial/inventory reconciliation or management. The new hire will be our ‘go-to numbers person’ in the team and will help us to sharpen up our processes across the board.

87,Lead Golang Engineer,JustWatch GmbH,Anywhere,"The Marketing Technology team is the most important part of the B2B side of JustWatch. We are the first fully Movie & TV show entertainment-centred marketing platform worldwide and had to build our tools from scratch. Our custom-built marketing platform allows our campaigns team to execute a volume of campaigns that, if done manually, would require a much bigger team.
 
Some of the topics we have recently worked on are:
- adding different advertising channels with their various API quirks
- expanding our system to cover new workflows as required by evolving campaign requirements
- and (as usual) eliminating bugs
 
The biggest challenge now is utilizing ML and algorithms to run campaigns with ridiculous efficiency and much better targeting.
 
Our stack
 
The marketing stack is based on services written in Golang, running in Kubernetes managed by Google Cloud Platform. We store data in PostgreSQL and monitor everything through Prometheus.
We use several advertising channels (and their APIs) such as Facebook and Google, and help our BI team to build relevant reports using a data warehouse based on Snowflake.
 
How we work, and what’s in it for you

Freedom and responsibility


We share context on what matters to the business. The delivery is up to you. That also means we don’t track vacation days, have flexible working hours, and allow working remotely


No company-wide Scrum or other enforced processes. We are agile without the artificial overhead


Great colleagues and a creative environment


We prefer asking forgiveness than asking for permission


Direct communication, no bloated hierarchy


Frequent open, honest and bi-directional feedback


What we expect from you

We are interested in the value you can bring rather than years of experience, the knowledge of every piece of our tech stack or well-curated references. Do you have a side project? Have you failed or succeeded at your own startup? Are you an expert in a piece of our stack?  Incredibly driven? Entrepreneurial? These are the achievements and traits we're interested in.

 
As a guideline for technology and skills

Experience as a backend engineer, deep familiarity with Go (Golang) language.


Advanced ability to work with relational databases, preferably Postgres.


Domain experience with DMPs, DSPs or within the AdTech/marketing tech ecosystem.


Experience leading a backend engineering team.

If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.   
 
The job can be fully remote or hybrid (our office is in Berlin and if you decide to relocate - we will fully support it)
 
We embrace our entrepreneurial responsibilities. Through our 6-figure environmental and social impact budget, we offset every employee’s carbon footprint, give back to the community, support causes that matter, and have recently implemented a wellbeing and mental health programme.

How to apply:  
 
Show your interest in any way that works for you, we simplified the application process -  send us whatever you have or just your Linkedin and a brief message explaining why you are a great fit for this role.

92,Growth Product Manager,Microverse,Anywhere,"Please make sure to read the application thoroughly and follow the appropriate application process, incomplete applications will not be considered.
About Microverse
We believe the place where you are born shouldn't determine your opportunities in life. We provide access to global opportunities by offering a world-class education no matter where you come from.
Microverse is an online school for software developers where students learn to work remotely with people from around the world. Students don't pay tuition until they get hired and start a global career. As of today, we have students in 100+ countries, and more than 90% of our alumni get a job within 6 months with an average salary increase of 240% working for companies like Microsoft, and VMWare.
We are backed by amazing investors worldwide, including Y Combinator, Northzone, General Catalyst, and many world-class angel investors, such as Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit (the creator of Gmail), Kevin Hartz (the founder of Eventbrite), and Erica Brescia (Github's COO).
We are a passionate and fast-moving team of global citizens working remotely from 12+ countries. Being remote-first and transparent, we take pride in the amazing remote culture we are building, while also making time for in-person time with team members around the world. We are a small but mighty team of curious, life-long learners, who love tackling challenges and helping shape the future of education.
Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. We're on a mission to change that. With the recent closing of our Series A, there has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team.
Job Description
We are looking for an experienced, hands-on Growth Product Manager (PM) who will be responsible for launching innovative products and experiences to drive growth at Microverse. You’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution of key growth product initiatives initially focused on unlocking remarkable experiences for our applicants and engaging them as students in the Microverse program.
We use No Code tools like Integromat and Zapier to integrate across numerous third-party tools, so we're able to automate workflows and processes outside of traditional software development. We're looking for a scrappy PM interested in getting their hands dirty designing and building prototypes themselves to quickly drive change. Experimenting and iterating will be a big part of your day-to-day work as you strive to achieve your OKRs.
The Growth area will start as a squad of one. Though you'll have access to designers and developers on our Program squad to collaborate with, the right person for this role is excited to ideate, prototype, and launch your own work. The Growth Product Manager will report to the Head of Product & Learning, and day-to-day you'll work with cross-functional team members, particularly with Marketing and Admissions.
We are currently growing our Product Development teams nearly from the ground up. You'll get an opportunity to be a highly impactful member of a fast-growing, mission-driven start-up with ambitious goals and a strong culture of care and collaboration.
While we are highly communicative and collaborative, we are also highly asynchronous and strive to abide by remote-first best practices. You'll send a lot of Loom videos, respond to Twist threads, and have comment conversations on documentation before meetings, so we can all stay off Zoom and maintain our flexible working schedules.
Duties and Responsibilities

Lead a team through the ideation, technical development, and launch of innovative products that drive Growth (initially focused on student acquisition, but open to other growth areas of the company like expanding employer partnerships).
Monitor the market and develop competitive analyses to drive Growth product development strategy.
Actively and compassionately listen to our applicants and develop clear user personas we can use in product discovery and development.
Balance your deep understanding of our user needs with our OKRs and business needs to define a product strategy and prioritize opportunities and requests accordingly.
Evaluate opportunities based on business feasibility, and collaborate with operational teams to ensure cost effectiveness of solutions.
Write product requirements, user stories, and be willing to dive into prototyping and launching Growth products with whatever tool is the best fit, either utilizing current tools we use like Integromat, Zapier, Gather.town, Webflow, etc. or adding a new one to the mix.
Develop products in an iterative way with a focus on MVPs and running experiments to ensure the viability of changes before cementing them into the service.
Perform idea feedback collection from applicants, students, and staff and run a product discovery process to turn it into a refined backlog prioritized for development work, initially by you and later by other designers and developers.
Develop business requirements and specification documents.
Develop KPIs and agile/development metrics for measuring progress at team and feature levels.

Education, Skills, and Experience

5+ years of experience in Growth / Product Management.
Proven track record for driving growth using a variety of models.
Highly structured and analytical thinking.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a track record of effectively prioritizing, communicating, and coordinating efforts across teams.
Highly empathetic toward our users and sensitive to their particular needs.
Experience prototyping and launching using third-party tools and no-code integration solutions (like Integromat).
Again: tools, tools, tools! You know tools, or know there is probably an existing tool out there and are not afraid to find it and add it to our No Code ecosystem if it makes sense to do so.
Excited by defining opportunities and developing solutions.
Love experimenting and following it up with hands-on iteration to drive change quickly.
Ability to conduct qualitative user interviews and quantitative research to explain and validate findings, without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.
Experience taking new product ideas from zero to one; skilled at iterative sprints.
Experience using analytics and data to inform product decisions and measure post-launch impact.
Experience leveraging a wide variety of product-based analytics and a method for balancing instinct and data.
Experience working in a startup (fast-growth environment & technology-focused company).

You Ideally...

Have driven growth in a start-up
Have a background in design that you can bring to designing experiences and workflows to drive growth
Understand the best practices in software development
Have worked remotely and asynchronously, especially for a startup
Will write the word ""cake"" somewhere in your cover letter

Each year, trillions of dollars worth of B2B trade is transacted using Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). EDI is difficult for modern businesses to work with. Convictional is changing that. 
 
Our Supplier Enablement Platform enables retailers and marketplaces to onboard, integrate, and transact with all of their suppliers.

We are continuing to learn about the massive value to be unlocked from all types of B2B trade, including marketplace, dropship and wholesale. We’re aiming at theoretical maximums, not feature-completeness, and intend to bring as many businesses along with us as we can.
 
Taking a new approach to an old problem is nothing special. Our team, and how we engage with each other, is. We are proud to be building a home for kind nerds who want to impact global trade. Our team is strengthened when we take a learning-first approach and seek out opportunities to debate the best customer-focused solutions. We value self-awareness and feel compelled to fully explore the hard questions. 
 
We are a fully distributed team with people located across Canada and the US. We encourage you to design your work schedule and environment so they’re optimal for you. We use email, not Slack. We default to no internal meetings and Deep Work Wednesdays. We expect you to go to coaching or therapy at least occasionally and adhere to 10% compound time.

We love our values
We’re building a fam, our chosen circle, around a set of values that guide how we work and interact with the world around us. Our cultural norms at work can’t be turned off when the computer’s away -- we live these in every part of our lives. Our team isn’t for everyone, so if you’re right for it, the following values should resonate strongly with how you live your life.

We’re intolerant to bad vibes, and genuinely love where we work (and want to keep it that way). We choose our fam by looking beyond a skillset - because roles can change - and surround ourselves with folks we want to spend our lives with.

We aim high and hire smart people to get there -- folks that use logic and critical thinking to make the best decisions. We look beyond the problem and quickly build context to come to the right solution; our ever-changing and high-pace environment requires a team of great autonomous thinkers. 

When we say “got it,” our team knows we’re owning it, we’re following through, and we’ll deliver beyond expectations. Put the effort into figuring things out yourself (hey, we’re all busy), and actively collaborate if you haven’t Got it; ownership also means knowing when to seek help and to never suffer in silence.

We’re a rare team of folks that genuinely love to work hard because we know that putting in the effort gets the win -- we’re the people that started our careers at the lemonade stand. Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle’s more fun when we’re winning together.

We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they’re pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There’s no hesitation in being direct; since we’re surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.

Being a young startup, we have built up a certain level of infrastructure already but now we need to prepare it for scaling (both of our users and of our team).

We have a strong belief in the value of testing - both integration and unit testing. All code goes through code review.
 
Deep work is valued throughout the company. We favour async communication over Slack and Notion. When we need to communicate in real-time we try to group meetings together to give everyone bigger blocks of interruption-free time.
 
Our problem-focused teams allow for regular innovation, which we foster further with workshops and hack-days, building things like study debriefing tools and experiments comparing our platform to competitors like MTurk.
 
Continuous learning and development is strongly encouraged. Everyone gets a personal development budget which they can put towards things like books, courses and conferences, and reserve times every fortnight for learning new things or working on creative side-projects.
 
We’re aware of the challenges of being a remote worker and work hard to foster team-spirit. We encourage remote chats over coffee with colleagues and have regular team meetings to keep everyone up to date with goings on across the company and introduce new joiners.
 
We believe that we are in the process of successfully building a company that people enjoy working for. Our employees should feel valued, supported, and fulfilled. We know that there’s always more that we could be doing and have regular conversations about what we can improve. Everyone’s opinion is important and all input is taken on board.

Color Of Change is one of the largest Black-led racial justice organizations in the country with more than 7 million email and SMS subscribers. We specialize in providing our members with easy, strategic actions to take in response to racial injustices - that when added with the voices of others - create the leverage for winning real-world change for Black people. From our work to replace district attorneys unwilling to punish violent police officers to pushing back against Silicon Valley enablers of white supremacists, Color Of Change has a track record of holding decision-makers - corporate and political - accountable to Black people.
ROLE SUMMARY
There has never been a more exciting time to work on technology at Color Of Change: the organization has been making deep investments in technology and data, including the recent hire of the organization’s first executive-level CTO. This scaling process includes the addition of new skill functions, including designers, product managers, engineers, and more to boost the overall capabilities of the team. We are creating cross-functional technology teams that build the software and data intelligence products needed to help our work reach the next level of impact.
With this increased capacity comes increased complexity. Due to time constraints and prioritization, the CTO will not be able to touch all the critical department functions and needs a partner in the running of the technology team.
KEY OBJECTIVES
The CTO will delegate important functions to her deputy so that she is able to focus on areas where she is uniquely equipped to lead. While the ultimate split of team responsibilities will depend on the profile of the hired candidate, we expect that the Deputy role will have day-to-day ownership of several key areas:

Taking the lead on HR processes for the team

Team coordination and communication

Ownership of team meetings, including agenda development, facilitation, and post-meeting follow-through
Champion best practices in internal communication across our collaboration platforms (Asana, Slack, etc.)
Work closely with the CTO to ensure important organization information is regularly shared with the team, and that important team information is regularly shared with the organization

Vendor management

Regularly review our vendor contracts to make sure we are getting what we need, and not paying for services we no longer use
Negotiate contracts with a resource stewardship mentality

Budgeting & Financial Management

Draft team budgets in coordination with team members
Work with the Finance team on reviewing budget-to-actuals and making adjustments as needed

Discrete Projects

Lead specific projects for which there is no clear natural owner, or when team capacity is stretched


Support the CTO as necessary

QUALIFICATIONS
We are looking for a creative and mature leader with vision and insight, recognizing that person could come from a range of backgrounds.
Some or all of these would be great to see in the ideal candidate’s background:

Experienced manager who understands what it takes to successfully run a complex team and navigate the accompanying people dynamics
An excellent project manager who can keep the trains running on time
Ready to wear many hats and do what it takes to support the CTO and ensure the team is successful
Demonstrated alignment with Color Of Change’s mission, and a strong commitment to racial and/or social justice
Budget management experience 
Experience working with cross-functional teams
Strong facilitation, prioritization, and influencing skills
Demonstrated experience and skills in running a remote, virtual team, including preparing for and running good virtual meetings
Experience and skill with collaboration tools like Asana, Slack, Miro, and others in order to help the team create strong internal processes
An ownership mentality
Willingness to engage with and execute on a plan, even in situations you may disagree on some of the elements
Orchestrate collaboration by removing roadblocks and fostering communication
Experience prioritizing competing demands
Demonstrated ability to manage and resolve conflict
Excellent written and verbal communication skills with a willingness to give (and receive) feedback.

Building tools to automate data verification and ensure the integrity of our reported metrics
Integrating data from multiple sources across internal and external partners
Working alongside Data Engineers and Project Managers to strive for greater functionality in our data systems

Our recruitment process in a nutshell


After receiving your application, you will have a first Hangout with our People Manager if your profile goes through our first screening. It will be an easy-going conversation where our People Manager will tell you a little more about Rebellion Pay as a company and our culture and growth, and you will be given more details about the team which you can be part of.


If the interview with our People Manager goes well, we will invite you to a second Hangout with our CTO and CPO. Here they will explain to you better our product and technological stack, our features, and here is where you can also clarify any more technical questions—take advantage of it!


If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test! Important: our test has nothing to do with Rebellion Pay—we do not ask you to do any feature or solve a problem of our app. You have 1 week to solve this test. You can upload it to a repository and pass the test to our Engineering team so they can review it.


Finally, we invite you to the last Hangout—the test review, again with our CTO and CPO. It is important here that your test is working correctly so that everything goes as well as possible and you can be calm and confident during the test review.

63,Front-end Engineer,surefoot,USA Only,"hi there, thanks for stopping by.
What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply.
what we do
We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in:

user experience research and design
full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)
data analytics
email

about your role and team
If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!
As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav – the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.
Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time – both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, “do the bare minimum”, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with “that's not in my job description” attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.
Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your “weird” show every once in awhile.
We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply. Now.
a day in the life of a front-end engineer

start your morning with a cup o' joe and fire up your computer to check emails, Slack and Asana.
it's 10:30am CST, time for our team Zoom stand-up to chit chat with teammates a bit, then talk through your priorities for the day and any blockers.
shortly after stand-up, you begin working on the big test in your queue – a navigation redesign for mobile and desktop devices.
once you've added the necessary events and configured the test in the testing tool, you'll pass it off to QA and take a break to refill your coffee or participate in some witty banter (complete with GIFs and custom emojis) in #watercooler.
as the day nears it's end, you'll patch a few bugs identified in QA, send the test to the strategic director for review and answer a few questions in Asana from your teammates about test details.
it's the first Wednesday of the month, so grab your beverage of choice and wrap up the day with the team at a Zoom virtual happy hour!

ready to apply?
Since we are a fully remote team, we have a somewhat atypical interview process. For the first step of the interview phase, we ask applicants to show basic competency in the necessary skill sets (don't worry, no hazing a la “live code fizzbuzz” is involved).
If all is well there, you'll move on to phase two which involves a Zoom video call to get to know one another a bit better. If we're feeling good about that, we'll contact your references.
And finally, if your references check out and confirm you're not a stabber, we'll ask you to do some actual paid work with us to determine fit for both parties.
To apply, please fill out our application form and be ready to submit a link to your code from this exercise.
 
----------
All applicants will receive a response. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds foster a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better business results. We strive to create workplaces that reflect the clients we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work. We are an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are also committed to working with candidates from all ability levels throughout the recruitment process to ensure they have what they need to be at their best. If you need accommodation during the application or interview process, please contact us to begin a conversation about your individual accessibility needs throughout the hiring process.

71,Finance Administrator,Empire Flippers LLC,Anywhere,"The Details to Keep in Mind
 
Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire right away.
When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work and teach you about each department within the business. 
As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into the low-level tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later becoming an independent fully fledged Finance Administrator for Empire Flippers.
It’s important to stress How We Work – which is from anywhere in the world. We are results driven and completely remote (pre-pandemic even), which for us equals total freedom! 
If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.
 
Love it. What’s the Catch?
 
We love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.
A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.
Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. 
Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer’s questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.
A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.
We focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. 
We’re made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this Finance Administrator position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.
 
What Skills Are Needed? 
 
We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.
You must have experience or training. We are looking for a skilled finance administrator with at least some experience/training in an accounting or finance role. The ideal candidate will use their experience to help create and make improvements to our financial processes. 
Numbers are your second language – Regardless of your experience, you will need to love numbers to excel at this role. We are looking for someone who lives and thrives in a spreadsheet. You will need to be diligent with figures and have that reflected in your work. 
You’re a confident and proactive self-starter. You will face obstacles and challenges. A buyer might be late on their earnout payment and you will need to chase them. An affiliate dashboard may not generate the reports we need and you will need to follow up with their support team. It will be down to you to manage that process and ensure everything is nicely kept up. 
Technical experience. To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 
You’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.
 
What’s the Finance Administrator Position Like? 
 
While we are an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not overly corporate. You’ll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.
It has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us. 
When you first come on board as a Finance Administrator, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company.  
You will become well versed in all of our finance processes, from how to reconcile the inventory of an eCommerce business to pulling revenue data from various affiliate dashboards. 
Once you have the basics down, we would love to lean on your accountancy background and make improvements to the current processes we have in place. No one in the team is tied to our processes and we actively encourage improvement across the board. 
You might be wondering, though … what does your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?
 
Here is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):
 

Reviewing the inventory levels of eCommerce businesses and creating spreadsheets of the total cost price inventory dollar amount. 
Running revenue reports for affiliate sites and calculating the net revenue due to both buyer and seller.  
Work with buyers and sellers to review these reconciliation amounts and answer any questions they have on the numbers. 
Work closely with other Migration team members to aid them with any specific reconciliation/accountancy work that needs to be completed on the deals they are managing
Work closely with the Migration Supervisor to improve our current reconciliation processes. 
Follow up with buyers for any payments due on deals that include an earnout. This typically means emailing/calling the buyer a few days before payment is due and also chasing if not paid.  
Review deals with a performance-related earnout to calculate the amount due to the seller. This typically means reviewing P&Ls/revenue reports to calculate whether or not a business has reached a certain benchmark over the selected time period.  
You will eventually take full responsibility for managing all of the earnouts included in our deals. 
Track and forecast different metrics related to earnouts. 

Ultimately, you’ll help our team grow and thrive by handling the numbers side of the migration process. 
 
What is a Finance Administrator for the Migration Team? 
 
The role will work closely with the supervisor and individual team members to carry out various financial tasks related to the process of buying/selling a business. 
You will also be responsible for reviewing and managing all of our earnouts and earnout processes. We currently have roughly 80 active earnouts in progress at any one time. In 2021, earnouts will also account for nearly 15% of our overall net fees target, meaning this role will have a direct impact on our bottom line. 
The ideal candidate will be extremely numbers-oriented and will have experience directly relating to financial/inventory reconciliation or management. The new hire will be our ‘go-to numbers person’ in the team and will help us to sharpen up our processes across the board.
We are looking to bring on a talented professional to join our Migration Department in the role of Finance Administrator. Training will commence at the start of January and run approximately 8-12 weeks. 
While the Migration team works during business hours in multiple time zones, the role itself is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world (*see USA resident requirements below). Be it the beaches in Mexico or in a mountain resort in the Swiss Alps – the choice is yours. 
This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth, and there is no sign of it slowing down. 
In order to keep hitting our goals, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying, selling, and investing in online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before. 
Are you ready to get started?
If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position.
 
What’s the Opportunity? 
 
Becoming a Finance Administrator makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers. 
You will represent our brand by working with buyers/sellers and promoting Empire Flipper’s company reputation as a great place to buy/sell a business while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. 
Your work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. You should have at least some direct experience or training in an accountancy role.
If you’re a strong numbers person and comfortable with various accountancy practices, we’d like to meet you.
Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours.
We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. 
We are going to rely on your experience to make our earnout process better and smoother for our customers and team. 
When you first start off, you will be training with our Migration Supervisor and other senior migration team members for 8-12 weeks. We typically meet in person during this time, but due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, we are assessing travel requirements during this process and will know more as the hire date gets closer.
Speaking of travel, our company holds bi-annual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building – we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. We are planning another meetup in the last quarter of 2022 (location TBD). So dust off your passport, and we’ll aim to see you then! 
For the first six months, you will be paid $2,700 USD per month during the probation period. After six months, you will be introduced to our compensation plan where you will earn a base pay of $3,000 USD per month plus a performance-based bonus. 
Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage. We also offer equity stake in the company.

87,Lead Golang Engineer,JustWatch GmbH,Anywhere,"The Marketing Technology team is the most important part of the B2B side of JustWatch. We are the first fully Movie & TV show entertainment-centred marketing platform worldwide and had to build our tools from scratch. Our custom-built marketing platform allows our campaigns team to execute a volume of campaigns that, if done manually, would require a much bigger team.
 
Some of the topics we have recently worked on are:
- adding different advertising channels with their various API quirks
- expanding our system to cover new workflows as required by evolving campaign requirements
- and (as usual) eliminating bugs
 
The biggest challenge now is utilizing ML and algorithms to run campaigns with ridiculous efficiency and much better targeting.
 
Our stack
 
The marketing stack is based on services written in Golang, running in Kubernetes managed by Google Cloud Platform. We store data in PostgreSQL and monitor everything through Prometheus.
We use several advertising channels (and their APIs) such as Facebook and Google, and help our BI team to build relevant reports using a data warehouse based on Snowflake.
 
How we work, and what’s in it for you

Freedom and responsibility


We share context on what matters to the business. The delivery is up to you. That also means we don’t track vacation days, have flexible working hours, and allow working remotely


No company-wide Scrum or other enforced processes. We are agile without the artificial overhead


Great colleagues and a creative environment


We prefer asking forgiveness than asking for permission


Direct communication, no bloated hierarchy


Frequent open, honest and bi-directional feedback


What we expect from you

We are interested in the value you can bring rather than years of experience, the knowledge of every piece of our tech stack or well-curated references. Do you have a side project? Have you failed or succeeded at your own startup? Are you an expert in a piece of our stack?  Incredibly driven? Entrepreneurial? These are the achievements and traits we're interested in.

 
As a guideline for technology and skills

Experience as a backend engineer, deep familiarity with Go (Golang) language.


Advanced ability to work with relational databases, preferably Postgres.


Domain experience with DMPs, DSPs or within the AdTech/marketing tech ecosystem.


Experience leading a backend engineering team.

If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.   
 
The job can be fully remote or hybrid (our office is in Berlin and if you decide to relocate - we will fully support it)
 
We embrace our entrepreneurial responsibilities. Through our 6-figure environmental and social impact budget, we offset every employee’s carbon footprint, give back to the community, support causes that matter, and have recently implemented a wellbeing and mental health programme. 
 
Read more about our culture in our blog post and Talent page: https://www.justwatch.com/de/Talent  
 
How to apply:  
 
Show your interest in any way that works for you, we simplified the application process -  send us whatever you have or just your Linkedin and a brief message explaining why you are a great fit for this role.  
 
If you have any questions, please reach out to Daria from our talent team via LinkedIn or apply to this role directly through this listing.

92,Growth Product Manager,Microverse,Anywhere,"Please make sure to read the application thoroughly and follow the appropriate application process, incomplete applications will not be considered.
About Microverse
We believe the place where you are born shouldn't determine your opportunities in life. We provide access to global opportunities by offering a world-class education no matter where you come from.
Microverse is an online school for software developers where students learn to work remotely with people from around the world. Students don't pay tuition until they get hired and start a global career. As of today, we have students in 100+ countries, and more than 90% of our alumni get a job within 6 months with an average salary increase of 240% working for companies like Microsoft, and VMWare.
We are backed by amazing investors worldwide, including Y Combinator, Northzone, General Catalyst, and many world-class angel investors, such as Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit (the creator of Gmail), Kevin Hartz (the founder of Eventbrite), and Erica Brescia (Github's COO).
We are a passionate and fast-moving team of global citizens working remotely from 12+ countries. Being remote-first and transparent, we take pride in the amazing remote culture we are building, while also making time for in-person time with team members around the world. We are a small but mighty team of curious, life-long learners, who love tackling challenges and helping shape the future of education.
Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. We're on a mission to change that. With the recent closing of our Series A, there has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team.
Job Description
We are looking for an experienced, hands-on Growth Product Manager (PM) who will be responsible for launching innovative products and experiences to drive growth at Microverse. You’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution of key growth product initiatives initially focused on unlocking remarkable experiences for our applicants and engaging them as students in the Microverse program.
We use No Code tools like Integromat and Zapier to integrate across numerous third-party tools, so we're able to automate workflows and processes outside of traditional software development. We're looking for a scrappy PM interested in getting their hands dirty designing and building prototypes themselves to quickly drive change. Experimenting and iterating will be a big part of your day-to-day work as you strive to achieve your OKRs.
The Growth area will start as a squad of one. Though you'll have access to designers and developers on our Program squad to collaborate with, the right person for this role is excited to ideate, prototype, and launch your own work. The Growth Product Manager will report to the Head of Product & Learning, and day-to-day you'll work with cross-functional team members, particularly with Marketing and Admissions.
We are currently growing our Product Development teams nearly from the ground up. You'll get an opportunity to be a highly impactful member of a fast-growing, mission-driven start-up with ambitious goals and a strong culture of care and collaboration.
While we are highly communicative and collaborative, we are also highly asynchronous and strive to abide by remote-first best practices. You'll send a lot of Loom videos, respond to Twist threads, and have comment conversations on documentation before meetings, so we can all stay off Zoom and maintain our flexible working schedules.
Duties and Responsibilities

Lead a team through the ideation, technical development, and launch of innovative products that drive Growth (initially focused on student acquisition, but open to other growth areas of the company like expanding employer partnerships).
Monitor the market and develop competitive analyses to drive Growth product development strategy.
Actively and compassionately listen to our applicants and develop clear user personas we can use in product discovery and development.
Balance your deep understanding of our user needs with our OKRs and business needs to define a product strategy and prioritize opportunities and requests accordingly.
Evaluate opportunities based on business feasibility, and collaborate with operational teams to ensure cost effectiveness of solutions.
Write product requirements, user stories, and be willing to dive into prototyping and launching Growth products with whatever tool is the best fit, either utilizing current tools we use like Integromat, Zapier, Gather.town, Webflow, etc. or adding a new one to the mix.
Develop products in an iterative way with a focus on MVPs and running experiments to ensure the viability of changes before cementing them into the service.
Perform idea feedback collection from applicants, students, and staff and run a product discovery process to turn it into a refined backlog prioritized for development work, initially by you and later by other designers and developers.
Develop business requirements and specification documents.
Develop KPIs and agile/development metrics for measuring progress at team and feature levels.

Education, Skills, and Experience

5+ years of experience in Growth / Product Management.
Proven track record for driving growth using a variety of models.
Highly structured and analytical thinking.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a track record of effectively prioritizing, communicating, and coordinating efforts across teams.
Highly empathetic toward our users and sensitive to their particular needs.
Experience prototyping and launching using third-party tools and no-code integration solutions (like Integromat).
Again: tools, tools, tools! You know tools, or know there is probably an existing tool out there and are not afraid to find it and add it to our No Code ecosystem if it makes sense to do so.
Excited by defining opportunities and developing solutions.
Love experimenting and following it up with hands-on iteration to drive change quickly.
Ability to conduct qualitative user interviews and quantitative research to explain and validate findings, without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.
Experience taking new product ideas from zero to one; skilled at iterative sprints.
Experience using analytics and data to inform product decisions and measure post-launch impact.
Experience leveraging a wide variety of product-based analytics and a method for balancing instinct and data.
Experience working in a startup (fast-growth environment & technology-focused company).

You Ideally...

Have driven growth in a start-up
Have a background in design that you can bring to designing experiences and workflows to drive growth
Understand the best practices in software development
Have worked remotely and asynchronously, especially for a startup
Will write the word ""cake"" somewhere in your cover letter

ABOUT US
Roadmunk is a privately held, high-growth startup in the rapidly emerging market of Product Management software. Roadmunk was born out of a problem our founders experienced personally: there was no simple way for product managers to collect feedback, surface customer-driven insights and create roadmaps using a single platform. So we went out and built it for ourselves, making sure it was collaborative, beautifully designed and secure. 
Today, we are home to thousands of forward-thinking product teams including those from organizations like Disney, Sonos and Under Armour. 
In the fall of 2019, Roadmunk was 12th in the Deloitte Technology Fast 50 Awards for its rapid revenue growth and bold innovation. The Fast 50 program recognizes Canada’s 50 fastest growing technology companies with the highest revenue-growth percentage over the past four years.

A Product Manager’s role at Roadmunk has a “meta element” because your expertise and skills will have a direct impact on the product management practice at our customers’ organizations. The product management team at Roadmunk is small, fast growing, and composed of seasoned professionals from a diverse set of product backgrounds. Our market opportunity is massive in scale and with a fast growing company like ours, offers unparalleled growth opportunities for Product Managers.
Key responsibilities

Experience using data to inform decisions while still having a high degree of bias for action
Ability to put yourself in our customers’ shoes and have deep customer empathy
Curiosity and enthusiasm to continuously learn and improve, and the humility to ask for help when needed
Demonstrable experience defining success metrics for your products/features and managing against them
A track record of numerous failures and the learnings you derived from them

We love our values
We’re building a fam, our chosen circle, around a set of values that guide how we work and interact with the world around us. Our cultural norms at work can’t be turned off when the computer’s away -- we live these in every part of our lives. Our team isn’t for everyone, so if you’re right for it, the following values should resonate strongly with how you live your life.

We’re intolerant to bad vibes, and genuinely love where we work (and want to keep it that way). We choose our fam by looking beyond a skillset - because roles can change - and surround ourselves with folks we want to spend our lives with.

We aim high and hire smart people to get there -- folks that use logic and critical thinking to make the best decisions. We look beyond the problem and quickly build context to come to the right solution; our ever-changing and high-pace environment requires a team of great autonomous thinkers. 

When we say “got it,” our team knows we’re owning it, we’re following through, and we’ll deliver beyond expectations. Put the effort into figuring things out yourself (hey, we’re all busy), and actively collaborate if you haven’t Got it; ownership also means knowing when to seek help and to never suffer in silence.

We’re a rare team of folks that genuinely love to work hard because we know that putting in the effort gets the win -- we’re the people that started our careers at the lemonade stand. Not at all costs, but we give it our all because our customers are hustling to grow their businesses, and the hustle’s more fun when we’re winning together.

We collaborate for more than the high-fives (although they’re pretty great), and our team thrives on timely and direct feedback. There’s no hesitation in being direct; since we’re surrounded by smart people, we embrace thoughtful and challenging perspectives.

Being a young startup, we have built up a certain level of infrastructure already but now we need to prepare it for scaling (both of our users and of our team).

Our problem-focused teams allow for regular innovation, which we foster further with workshops and hack-days, building things like study debriefing tools and experiments comparing our platform to competitors like MTurk.
 
Continuous learning and development is strongly encouraged. Everyone gets a personal development budget which they can put towards things like books, courses and conferences, and reserve times every fortnight for learning new things or working on creative side-projects.
 
We’re aware of the challenges of being a remote worker and work hard to foster team-spirit. We encourage remote chats over coffee with colleagues and have regular team meetings to keep everyone up to date with goings on across the company and introduce new joiners.
 
We believe that we are in the process of successfully building a company that people enjoy working for. Our employees should feel valued, supported, and fulfilled. We know that there’s always more that we could be doing and have regular conversations about what we can improve. Everyone’s opinion is important and all input is taken on board.

32,Deputy Chief Technology Officer,Colorofchange,USA Only,"ABOUT COLOR OF CHANGE
Color Of Change is one of the largest Black-led racial justice organizations in the country with more than 7 million email and SMS subscribers. We specialize in providing our members with easy, strategic actions to take in response to racial injustices - that when added with the voices of others - create the leverage for winning real-world change for Black people. From our work to replace district attorneys unwilling to punish violent police officers to pushing back against Silicon Valley enablers of white supremacists, Color Of Change has a track record of holding decision-makers - corporate and political - accountable to Black people.
ROLE SUMMARY
There has never been a more exciting time to work on technology at Color Of Change: the organization has been making deep investments in technology and data, including the recent hire of the organization’s first executive-level CTO. This scaling process includes the addition of new skill functions, including designers, product managers, engineers, and more to boost the overall capabilities of the team. We are creating cross-functional technology teams that build the software and data intelligence products needed to help our work reach the next level of impact.
With this increased capacity comes increased complexity. Due to time constraints and prioritization, the CTO will not be able to touch all the critical department functions and needs a partner in the running of the technology team.
KEY OBJECTIVES
The CTO will delegate important functions to her deputy so that she is able to focus on areas where she is uniquely equipped to lead. While the ultimate split of team responsibilities will depend on the profile of the hired candidate, we expect that the Deputy role will have day-to-day ownership of several key areas:
Team performance management

Hiring, including drafting job descriptions and engaging with the internal HR team, and when necessary, external recruiters
Goal-setting processes, both at the team and individual levels
Ensuring quality management practices across the team, including strong 1:1s, performance reviews, and related processes
Taking the lead on HR processes for the team

Team coordination and communication

Ownership of team meetings, including agenda development, facilitation, and post-meeting follow-through
Champion best practices in internal communication across our collaboration platforms (Asana, Slack, etc.)
Work closely with the CTO to ensure important organization information is regularly shared with the team, and that important team information is regularly shared with the organization

Vendor management

Regularly review our vendor contracts to make sure we are getting what we need, and not paying for services we no longer use
Negotiate contracts with a resource stewardship mentality

Budgeting & Financial Management

Draft team budgets in coordination with team members
Work with the Finance team on reviewing budget-to-actuals and making adjustments as needed

Discrete Projects

Lead specific projects for which there is no clear natural owner, or when team capacity is stretched


Support the CTO as necessary

QUALIFICATIONS
We are looking for a creative and mature leader with vision and insight, recognizing that person could come from a range of backgrounds.
Some or all of these would be great to see in the ideal candidate’s background:

Experienced manager who understands what it takes to successfully run a complex team and navigate the accompanying people dynamics
An excellent project manager who can keep the trains running on time
Ready to wear many hats and do what it takes to support the CTO and ensure the team is successful
Demonstrated alignment with Color Of Change’s mission, and a strong commitment to racial and/or social justice
Budget management experience 
Experience working with cross-functional teams
Strong facilitation, prioritization, and influencing skills
Demonstrated experience and skills in running a remote, virtual team, including preparing for and running good virtual meetings
Experience and skill with collaboration tools like Asana, Slack, Miro, and others in order to help the team create strong internal processes
An ownership mentality
Willingness to engage with and execute on a plan, even in situations you may disagree on some of the elements
Orchestrate collaboration by removing roadblocks and fostering communication
Experience prioritizing competing demands
Demonstrated ability to manage and resolve conflict
Excellent written and verbal communication skills with a willingness to give (and receive) feedback.

40,Junior Data Engineer,Uken,Canada Only,"Uken builds games that people everywhere love. Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? and Jeopardy! World Tour are the top 2 trivia games, engaging millions of global players every month. In 2020, Uken released Ava’s Manor, a solitaire game where users renovate and decorate the manor while discovering mysterious clues and dabbling in a romantic love story. Uken’s foray into narrative games is an exciting opportunity for the company. 
 
We consider our Ukenites to be data-driven designers, technologists, and artists. Through collaboration, we pair the craft of design with feedback and data to deliver a pace and rhythm in each game session that immerses our audience and engages them for years. We have a quirky, nerdy culture that fosters creativity, collaboration, quality ideas, innovation, and a data-driven mindset. We believe in moving quickly and improving constantly and that mantra is reflected in the weekly updates we make to our games and internal technologies. We have an appetite for pushing technical boundaries but with a focus on practical use.
 
We maintain our presence within the tech community by running and hosting numerous technical events and meetups. Our commitment to Engineering and Technology is also seen in our service-oriented architecture with well-modularized responsibilities that allow us to build, maintain and scale our applications. We use both blocking and asynchronous non-blocking programming models when advantageous to do so. Our dozens of game services are built to scale beyond a million DAU while maintaining an average of single-digit millisecond response times. We use a diverse set of both NoSQL and traditional relational databases (e.g.: Aurora, Cassandra, Redis, Redshift), modern JVM (Java and Scala) frameworks, and programming methods. We have a deep understanding of the AWS cloud where we've been running all our infrastructure for almost a decade.
 
At Uken, we believe that understanding data is a fundamental skill and when leveraged well, it can be used to elevate even the best-designed products. This is why we’re thrilled to be adding a Data Engineer to our Platform team. We are looking for someone to work alongside our engineers, product and project managers to improve and maintain the integrity of our data systems which are responsible for transforming the millions of raw logs we capture each day into actionable insights used by everybody in the company. These actionable insights are foundational to improving the user experience in our games in a meaningful way. This role is intended for a candidate with a strong grasp of computer science fundamentals.  
 
As a Ukenite, you'll be working on meaningful things like:

Acquiring a complete understanding of how data moves and is transformed across our systems from raw event logs to critical reports consumed by internal teams
Creating and maintaining optimal data pipelines within our architecture
Building jobs and tools on top of the data pipeline to provide actionable insights into key metrics
Debugging discrepancy issues that come up in the ETL (e.g. misaligned metrics with 3rd parties, duplicates, failures in the ETL, performance bottlenecks)
Building tools to automate data verification and ensure the integrity of our reported metrics
Integrating data from multiple sources across internal and external partners
Working alongside Data Engineers and Project Managers to strive for greater functionality in our data systems

 
Your background should include:

Experience with object-oriented, functional, and scripting languages e.g.: Scala, Python, Java
SQL skills
Experience with relational SQL and NoSQL databases such as including Redshift, Postgres, Redis, and MySQL
Experience with tools used for large scale data processing: Spark, Hadoop, Kafka
Experience with cloud services such as Amazon AWS 

 
It'd be a big plus if you have:

Knowledge of message queuing, stream processing, and highly scalable ‘big data’ technologies
Understanding of the different federated querying, data warehousing, and BI technologies and how they work together to form a Data Platform.

Career Progression! If you enjoy working in a fast-paced, innovative environment, you'll get on well here!


Remote and flexible working hours! We all have many spheres in our busy lives: family, fitness (well, some of us), work, study, and community interests.


Also, you could choose to work from our nice office in Madrid. In Serrano 88. Or maybe a mix of Remote and Office—it’s totally up to you!


Seeing your ideas become a reality—being part of a small and fast-growing start-up means you have plenty of chances to grow with us to the next level!


A young and international team of authentic professionals who are passionate about their product. We speak Spanish, English, German, Portuguese, and Lithuanian—take your pick!



Our recruitment process in a nutshell


After receiving your application, you will have a first Hangout with our People Manager if your profile goes through our first screening. It will be an easy-going conversation where our People Manager will tell you a little more about Rebellion Pay as a company and our culture and growth, and you will be given more details about the team which you can be part of.


If the interview with our People Manager goes well, we will invite you to a second Hangout with our CTO and CPO. Here they will explain to you better our product and technological stack, our features, and here is where you can also clarify any more technical questions—take advantage of it!


If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test! Important: our test has nothing to do with Rebellion Pay—we do not ask you to do any feature or solve a problem of our app. You have 1 week to solve this test. You can upload it to a repository and pass the test to our Engineering team so they can review it.


Finally, we invite you to the last Hangout—the test review, again with our CTO and CPO. It is important here that your test is working correctly so that everything goes as well as possible and you can be calm and confident during the test review.


Hope to see you here soon!

After receiving your application, you will have a first Hangout with our People Manager if your profile goes through our first screening. It will be an easy-going conversation where our People Manager will tell you a little more about Rebellion Pay as a company and our culture and growth, and you will be given more details about the team which you can be part of.


If the interview with our People Manager goes well, we will invite you to a second Hangout with our CTO and CPO. Here they will explain to you better our product and technological stack, our features, and here is where you can also clarify any more technical questions—take advantage of it!


If you make it this far... Congratulations! Now is the time to show your skills—a technical test! Important: our test has nothing to do with Rebellion Pay—we do not ask you to do any feature or solve a problem of our app. You have 1 week to solve this test. You can upload it to a repository and pass the test to our Engineering team so they can review it.


Finally, we invite you to the last Hangout—the test review, again with our CTO and CPO. It is important here that your test is working correctly so that everything goes as well as possible and you can be calm and confident during the test review.


Hope to see you here soon!

63,Front-end Engineer,surefoot,USA Only,"hi there, thanks for stopping by.
What follows is a bit lengthy, but will give you a better idea of what we do, what this role entails and how to apply.
what we do
We're a boutique growth agency that gives a damn about our work, our clients, our people, and doing the right thing. We specialize in:

user experience research and design
full-service a/b testing and personalization (aka conversion rate optimization)
data analytics
email

about your role and team
If you would rather feel trusted to use your expertise and problem-solve than have your manager hawking over your shoulder micromanaging you, keep reading! Here at surefoot, we hire smart, entrepreneurially-minded folks and get out of their way so they have the space to deliver real value to our clients. Leave the wasted time, infighting and red tape to someone else. You didn't become a developer to deal with that stress mess day in and day out!
As an engineer at surefoot, you'll work closely with product managers, project managers, designers and QA to build tests the team has prioritized for e-commerce clients like Hydro Flask, Peak Design, OXO, Made In and others. This is a unique front-end role, as you'll be writing code that is inserted into websites via 3rd party testing tools like Dynamic Yield, Convert or Google Optimize. Ethical hacking, of sorts. Something important we want you to know ahead of time is that this job is a bit different than your standard front-end gig. You won't be working on a single app or feature for several months. Instead, you'll be writing smaller chunks of code on a lot of different projects for a variety of clients. One day it could be an exit intent modal, the next could be restructuring a nav – the possibilities are endless. Your code will sometimes (often) be part of a losing test and never see the light of production, which is one reason we value efficiency over perfect, beautiful code.
Internally, you'll enjoy collaborating with kind, supportive co-workers who respect you and your time – both at and away from the virtual office. You'll be recognized by peers, leadership and clients for your curiosity and attention to detail, which are critical to your success. In fact, “do the bare minimum”, dependent personalities don't last long here. Nor do people with “that's not in my job description” attitudes. When smart people collaborate instead of compete and bring solutions instead of problems, amazing things happen.
Speaking of collaboration, that's something you'll occasionally do with our clients. We bend over backwards (but not forwards) to make sure they're happy. Our goal is to be the best, most helpful agency they've ever worked with. To help us achieve that goal, we encourage you to share and celebrate your authentic self day in-and-day-out with co-workers and clients alike. Even if it means letting your “weird” show every once in awhile.
We'll be honest; surefoot isn't for everyone. We encourage and expect you to use your expertise, make decisions without a lot of oversight, go above and beyond to help a teammate or client, spend time to thoughtfully communicate asynchronously, and manage your own work schedule. If you're a humble team player who likes to see and contribute to the success of something greater than yourself, then we want you to apply. Now.
a day in the life of a front-end engineer

start your morning with a cup o' joe and fire up your computer to check emails, Slack and Asana.
it's 10:30am CST, time for our team Zoom stand-up to chit chat with teammates a bit, then talk through your priorities for the day and any blockers.
shortly after stand-up, you begin working on the big test in your queue – a navigation redesign for mobile and desktop devices.
once you've added the necessary events and configured the test in the testing tool, you'll pass it off to QA and take a break to refill your coffee or participate in some witty banter (complete with GIFs and custom emojis) in #watercooler.
as the day nears it's end, you'll patch a few bugs identified in QA, send the test to the strategic director for review and answer a few questions in Asana from your teammates about test details.
it's the first Wednesday of the month, so grab your beverage of choice and wrap up the day with the team at a Zoom virtual happy hour!

ready to apply?
Since we are a fully remote team, we have a somewhat atypical interview process. For the first step of the interview phase, we ask applicants to show basic competency in the necessary skill sets (don't worry, no hazing a la “live code fizzbuzz” is involved).
If all is well there, you'll move on to phase two which involves a Zoom video call to get to know one another a bit better. If we're feeling good about that, we'll contact your references.
And finally, if your references check out and confirm you're not a stabber, we'll ask you to do some actual paid work with us to determine fit for both parties.
To apply, please fill out our application form and be ready to submit a link to your code from this exercise.
 
----------
All applicants will receive a response. We know through experience that different ideas, perspectives and backgrounds foster a stronger and more creative work environment that delivers better business results. We strive to create workplaces that reflect the clients we serve and where everyone feels empowered to bring their full, authentic selves to work. We are an equal opportunity employer and we are committed to building a company that embraces and celebrates diversity and inclusion. We do not discriminate on the basis of race, religion, color, national origin, gender, gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, age, marital status, veteran status, or disability status. We are also committed to working with candidates from all ability levels throughout the recruitment process to ensure they have what they need to be at their best.

71,Finance Administrator,Empire Flippers LLC,Anywhere,"The Details to Keep in Mind
 
Remember, we’re not going to throw you into the fire right away.
When you first come on board, you’re going to learn about our company. We will do a deep dive into how our processes and systems work and teach you about each department within the business. 
As you get better acquainted with our company and processes, you will dive into the low-level tasks, starting off with plenty of guidance and later becoming an independent fully fledged Finance Administrator for Empire Flippers.
It’s important to stress How We Work – which is from anywhere in the world. We are results driven and completely remote (pre-pandemic even), which for us equals total freedom! 
If this all sounds overwhelming yet exciting to you, then apply! You might be surprised how perfect you are for this role.
 
Love it. What’s the Catch?
 
We love our team members and our work, but that still means you will need to perform up to our expectations. Hopefully, you will exceed those expectations and take us to new heights with the skills you bring to the table.
A big part of our company is about experiencing what the world has to offer and going after it. That being said, we also work hard.
Sometimes we have to work weird hours. It is not uncommon to take a 3 a.m. phone call if you’re in Thailand to connect with someone over in the U.S. Or vice versa. You will need to be someone who is ultra-flexible. Our business is truly global, and we have customers in every corner of the globe. 
Sometimes we really do work next to the pool. We might take a long break in the middle of the day, but burn the midnight oil early in the morning and late into the night with a 12-hour work day. That isn’t every day, but it does happen when we need to finish a project or answer a customer’s questions, so you’ll need to be prepared for that.
A lot of people would love to have a side gig or a gap year experience that allows them to travel the world before finding a job back home. That is not this job.
We focus on a strong life/work balance and encourage our team to tackle their bucket lists while working in an exciting, challenging, and ever changing industry. 
We’re made up of a team of successful entrepreneurs and former corporate professionals and we want you to become a long-term team member with us. Ultimately, we want this Finance Administrator position to grow into a profitable career for both you and the company.
 
What Skills Are Needed? 
 
We believe in hiring people who are a good fit with us culturally. We want people who are hungry to learn, but also people that will be fun to work with.
You must have experience or training. We are looking for a skilled finance administrator with at least some experience/training in an accounting or finance role. The ideal candidate will use their experience to help create and make improvements to our financial processes. 
Numbers are your second language – Regardless of your experience, you will need to love numbers to excel at this role. We are looking for someone who lives and thrives in a spreadsheet. You will need to be diligent with figures and have that reflected in your work. 
You’re a confident and proactive self-starter. You will face obstacles and challenges. A buyer might be late on their earnout payment and you will need to chase them. An affiliate dashboard may not generate the reports we need and you will need to follow up with their support team. It will be down to you to manage that process and ensure everything is nicely kept up. 
Technical experience. To be successful, you must have a working knowledge of both Microsoft Excel and Google Sheets. 
You’re excited about expanding the Empire Flippers brand. We love hiring people that are passionate about the online business industry. In many ways, we really are changing lives. We want you to be on board with our mission, participate in industry conversations, and get people excited about working with us.
 
What’s the Finance Administrator Position Like? 
 
While we are an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not overly corporate. You’ll work with management in all teams to make sure the job gets done. We believe in collaboration, and that means every department in our company comes together to help bring a project to fruition.
It has been an effective strategy, and has worked well for us. 
When you first come on board as a Finance Administrator, you will start learning more about our business and the different kinds of roles we have in our company.  
You will become well versed in all of our finance processes, from how to reconcile the inventory of an eCommerce business to pulling revenue data from various affiliate dashboards. 
Once you have the basics down, we would love to lean on your accountancy background and make improvements to the current processes we have in place. No one in the team is tied to our processes and we actively encourage improvement across the board. 
You might be wondering, though … what does your daily work routine really look like once you’re up and going?
 
Here is a list of daily tasks we’ll expect from you (though this isn’t an exhaustive list and could change):
 

Reviewing the inventory levels of eCommerce businesses and creating spreadsheets of the total cost price inventory dollar amount. 
Running revenue reports for affiliate sites and calculating the net revenue due to both buyer and seller.  
Work with buyers and sellers to review these reconciliation amounts and answer any questions they have on the numbers. 
Work closely with other Migration team members to aid them with any specific reconciliation/accountancy work that needs to be completed on the deals they are managing
Work closely with the Migration Supervisor to improve our current reconciliation processes. 
Follow up with buyers for any payments due on deals that include an earnout. This typically means emailing/calling the buyer a few days before payment is due and also chasing if not paid.  
Review deals with a performance-related earnout to calculate the amount due to the seller. This typically means reviewing P&Ls/revenue reports to calculate whether or not a business has reached a certain benchmark over the selected time period.  
You will eventually take full responsibility for managing all of the earnouts included in our deals. 
Track and forecast different metrics related to earnouts. 

Ultimately, you’ll help our team grow and thrive by handling the numbers side of the migration process. 
 
What is a Finance Administrator for the Migration Team? 
 
The role will work closely with the supervisor and individual team members to carry out various financial tasks related to the process of buying/selling a business. 
You will also be responsible for reviewing and managing all of our earnouts and earnout processes. We currently have roughly 80 active earnouts in progress at any one time. In 2021, earnouts will also account for nearly 15% of our overall net fees target, meaning this role will have a direct impact on our bottom line. 
The ideal candidate will be extremely numbers-oriented and will have experience directly relating to financial/inventory reconciliation or management. The new hire will be our ‘go-to numbers person’ in the team and will help us to sharpen up our processes across the board.
We are looking to bring on a talented professional to join our Migration Department in the role of Finance Administrator. Training will commence at the start of January and run approximately 8-12 weeks. 
While the Migration team works during business hours in multiple time zones, the role itself is 100% location independent, allowing you to live anywhere in the world (*see USA resident requirements below). Be it the beaches in Mexico or in a mountain resort in the Swiss Alps – the choice is yours. 
This is a huge opportunity for you to work with one of the fastest-growing companies in the U.S. and learn the ins and outs of the online business world. Over the last couple of years, our company has seen explosive growth, and there is no sign of it slowing down. 
In order to keep hitting our goals, we need to expand our horizons and improve our customer experience to a point that makes us the de-facto standard for buying, selling, and investing in online businesses. Your work will help propel the industry forward to new levels not seen before. 
Are you ready to get started?
If this sounds like an exciting opportunity for you, then read on to learn more about our company and how to apply for the position.
 
What’s the Opportunity? 
 
Becoming a Finance Administrator makes you a critical part of the team at Empire Flippers. 
You will represent our brand by working with buyers/sellers and promoting Empire Flipper’s company reputation as a great place to buy/sell a business while learning skills that will last you a lifetime in the online business world. 
Your work ethic and skill set will have a direct impact on our growth. You should have at least some direct experience or training in an accountancy role.
If you’re a strong numbers person and comfortable with various accountancy practices, we’d like to meet you.
Our company is built on a culture of remote work, travel, and living life on your terms. Being a location-independent full-time position is one of the many benefits! You’ll be free to work anywhere in the world that serves your creativity best. The choice is yours.
We aren’t going to chain you to a cubicle. While we’re an Inc. 5000 company, we’re not a Fortune 500 company. You won’t be some badge number in the corporate machine. We will want your input and insight. 
We are going to rely on your experience to make our earnout process better and smoother for our customers and team. 
When you first start off, you will be training with our Migration Supervisor and other senior migration team members for 8-12 weeks. We typically meet in person during this time, but due to COVID-19 and global travel restrictions, we are assessing travel requirements during this process and will know more as the hire date gets closer.
Speaking of travel, our company holds bi-annual meetups where we gather in a fun location and collaborate over the latest projects and ideas. The purpose of the meetup is team building – we make sure there are a variety of activities outside of company presentations and breakout sessions. We are planning another meetup in the last quarter of 2022 (location TBD). So dust off your passport, and we’ll aim to see you then! 
For the first six months, you will be paid $2,700 USD per month during the probation period. After six months, you will be introduced to our compensation plan where you will earn a base pay of $3,000 USD per month plus a performance-based bonus. 
Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $40,000-$46,000 USD per year, and have paid, international healthcare coverage. We also offer equity stake in the company.

87,Lead Golang Engineer,JustWatch GmbH,Anywhere,"The Marketing Technology team is the most important part of the B2B side of JustWatch. We are the first fully Movie & TV show entertainment-centred marketing platform worldwide and had to build our tools from scratch. Our custom-built marketing platform allows our campaigns team to execute a volume of campaigns that, if done manually, would require a much bigger team.
 
Some of the topics we have recently worked on are:
- adding different advertising channels with their various API quirks
- expanding our system to cover new workflows as required by evolving campaign requirements
- and (as usual) eliminating bugs
 
The biggest challenge now is utilizing ML and algorithms to run campaigns with ridiculous efficiency and much better targeting.
 
Our stack
 
The marketing stack is based on services written in Golang, running in Kubernetes managed by Google Cloud Platform. We store data in PostgreSQL and monitor everything through Prometheus.
We use several advertising channels (and their APIs) such as Facebook and Google, and help our BI team to build relevant reports using a data warehouse based on Snowflake.
 
How we work, and what’s in it for you

Freedom and responsibility


We share context on what matters to the business. The delivery is up to you. That also means we don’t track vacation days, have flexible working hours, and allow working remotely


No company-wide Scrum or other enforced processes. We are agile without the artificial overhead


Great colleagues and a creative environment


We prefer asking forgiveness than asking for permission


Direct communication, no bloated hierarchy


Frequent open, honest and bi-directional feedback


What we expect from you

We are interested in the value you can bring rather than years of experience, the knowledge of every piece of our tech stack or well-curated references. Do you have a side project? Have you failed or succeeded at your own startup? Are you an expert in a piece of our stack?  Incredibly driven? Entrepreneurial? These are the achievements and traits we're interested in.

 
As a guideline for technology and skills

Experience as a backend engineer, deep familiarity with Go (Golang) language.


Advanced ability to work with relational databases, preferably Postgres.


Domain experience with DMPs, DSPs or within the AdTech/marketing tech ecosystem.


Experience leading a backend engineering team.

If you feel like you are missing some of the hard skills – don’t worry, we are hiring for the attitude, values, and personality.   
 
The job can be fully remote or hybrid (our office is in Berlin and if you decide to relocate - we will fully support it)
 
We embrace our entrepreneurial responsibilities. Through our 6-figure environmental and social impact budget, we offset every employee’s carbon footprint, give back to the community, support causes that matter, and have recently implemented a wellbeing and mental health programme.

How to apply:  
 
Show your interest in any way that works for you, we simplified the application process -  send us whatever you have or just your Linkedin and a brief message explaining why you are a great fit for this role.  
 
If you have any questions, please reach out to Daria from our talent team via LinkedIn or apply to this role directly through this listing. 
 
 
JustWatch takes diversity and equal opportunity in a serious way. Our goal is to build a team that represents a variety of backgrounds, perspectives, and skills. We commit to being inclusive.

92,Growth Product Manager,Microverse,Anywhere,"Please make sure to read the application thoroughly and follow the appropriate application process, incomplete applications will not be considered.
About Microverse
We believe the place where you are born shouldn't determine your opportunities in life. We provide access to global opportunities by offering a world-class education no matter where you come from.
Microverse is an online school for software developers where students learn to work remotely with people from around the world. Students don't pay tuition until they get hired and start a global career. As of today, we have students in 100+ countries, and more than 90% of our alumni get a job within 6 months with an average salary increase of 240% working for companies like Microsoft, and VMWare.
We are backed by amazing investors worldwide, including Y Combinator, Northzone, General Catalyst, and many world-class angel investors, such as Paul Graham, Paul Buchheit (the creator of Gmail), Kevin Hartz (the founder of Eventbrite), and Erica Brescia (Github's COO).
We are a passionate and fast-moving team of global citizens working remotely from 12+ countries. Being remote-first and transparent, we take pride in the amazing remote culture we are building, while also making time for in-person time with team members around the world. We are a small but mighty team of curious, life-long learners, who love tackling challenges and helping shape the future of education.
Talent is universal, but opportunity is not. We're on a mission to change that. With the recent closing of our Series A, there has never been a more exciting time to join our growing team.
Job Description
We are looking for an experienced, hands-on Growth Product Manager (PM) who will be responsible for launching innovative products and experiences to drive growth at Microverse. You’ll own the strategy, roadmap, and execution of key growth product initiatives initially focused on unlocking remarkable experiences for our applicants and engaging them as students in the Microverse program.
We use No Code tools like Integromat and Zapier to integrate across numerous third-party tools, so we're able to automate workflows and processes outside of traditional software development. We're looking for a scrappy PM interested in getting their hands dirty designing and building prototypes themselves to quickly drive change. Experimenting and iterating will be a big part of your day-to-day work as you strive to achieve your OKRs.
The Growth area will start as a squad of one. Though you'll have access to designers and developers on our Program squad to collaborate with, the right person for this role is excited to ideate, prototype, and launch your own work. The Growth Product Manager will report to the Head of Product & Learning, and day-to-day you'll work with cross-functional team members, particularly with Marketing and Admissions.
We are currently growing our Product Development teams nearly from the ground up. You'll get an opportunity to be a highly impactful member of a fast-growing, mission-driven start-up with ambitious goals and a strong culture of care and collaboration.
While we are highly communicative and collaborative, we are also highly asynchronous and strive to abide by remote-first best practices. You'll send a lot of Loom videos, respond to Twist threads, and have comment conversations on documentation before meetings, so we can all stay off Zoom and maintain our flexible working schedules.
Duties and Responsibilities

Lead a team through the ideation, technical development, and launch of innovative products that drive Growth (initially focused on student acquisition, but open to other growth areas of the company like expanding employer partnerships).
Monitor the market and develop competitive analyses to drive Growth product development strategy.
Actively and compassionately listen to our applicants and develop clear user personas we can use in product discovery and development.
Balance your deep understanding of our user needs with our OKRs and business needs to define a product strategy and prioritize opportunities and requests accordingly.
Evaluate opportunities based on business feasibility, and collaborate with operational teams to ensure cost effectiveness of solutions.
Write product requirements, user stories, and be willing to dive into prototyping and launching Growth products with whatever tool is the best fit, either utilizing current tools we use like Integromat, Zapier, Gather.town, Webflow, etc. or adding a new one to the mix.
Develop products in an iterative way with a focus on MVPs and running experiments to ensure the viability of changes before cementing them into the service.
Perform idea feedback collection from applicants, students, and staff and run a product discovery process to turn it into a refined backlog prioritized for development work, initially by you and later by other designers and developers.
Develop business requirements and specification documents.
Develop KPIs and agile/development metrics for measuring progress at team and feature levels.

Education, Skills, and Experience

5+ years of experience in Growth / Product Management.
Proven track record for driving growth using a variety of models.
Highly structured and analytical thinking.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills with a track record of effectively prioritizing, communicating, and coordinating efforts across teams.
Highly empathetic toward our users and sensitive to their particular needs.
Experience prototyping and launching using third-party tools and no-code integration solutions (like Integromat).
Again: tools, tools, tools! You know tools, or know there is probably an existing tool out there and are not afraid to find it and add it to our No Code ecosystem if it makes sense to do so.
Excited by defining opportunities and developing solutions.
Love experimenting and following it up with hands-on iteration to drive change quickly.
Ability to conduct qualitative user interviews and quantitative research to explain and validate findings, without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.
Experience taking new product ideas from zero to one; skilled at iterative sprints.
Experience using analytics and data to inform product decisions and measure post-launch impact.
Experience leveraging a wide variety of product-based analytics and a method for balancing instinct and data.
Experience working in a startup (fast-growth environment & technology-focused company).

You Ideally...

Have driven growth in a start-up
Have a background in design that you can bring to designing experiences and workflows to drive growth
Understand the best practices in software development
Have worked remotely and asynchronously, especially for a startup
Will write the word ""cake"" somewhere in your cover letter

13,Sales Engineer,Gruntwork,North America Only,"What's the opportunity?
We've grown to millions of dollars in annual revenue with zero outside investment/debt, near-zero marketing budget, and a small number of software engineers who handle all sales calls in addition to their core work. Now we're ready to take our sales to the next level!
What You'll Work On

Manage deals. Own the deal from inquiry through contract signature. Engage with both large enterprises and startups.
Showcase the product. Show customers how the Gruntwork product works. Answer both their high-level strategic questions and common technical questions. When necessary, collaborate with our engineering team to answer a detailed question or build your knowledge.
Make customer-driven tweaks where needed. Does the customer want to see an integration out of the box we don't yet support? You can add it directly, following the patterns we've laid down with other integrations.
Develop new markets. Our product works well for customers building greenfield in AWS or doing migrations. What kinds of customers might find themselves in that situation? Identify those opportunities, figure out what the customer wants, and write content/guides to help showcase our solution.

Requirements

Experience in tech. You understand the cloud, are familiar with core elements of at least one major cloud provider, and have experience selling to software engineers. Ideally, you have some kind of background in engineering or coding from earlier in your career.
Technical skill. You're tech-savvy, can build a full mental model of our product, and can learn to demo a core part of it on your own. At the same time, you know when to bring in the product engineers to assist.
Sales skill. You can effectively qualify leads, understand customer needs, demo our product, and close the deal with a range of customers from startups to large enterprises. You delight both in knowing the product and signing up customers who will genuinely benefit from it.
Moral grounding. You feel comfortable saying no when necessary so that we can all sleep better at night. In general, you do the right thing for customers, for Gruntwork, and for yourself.

Benefits

Above-Market Salary. To reduce bias and increase transparency, we compute all salaries using formulas. The formula factors in your title and location and uses a multiplier to produce a result that's above market for that title and location.
Profit-Sharing Bonus. We set aside a pot of money at the end of each year based on profits and distribute bonuses according to a formula that uses as inputs your level within the company and the length of your tenure at the company.
Performance Bonus. We give performance-based bonuses as often as once a quarter, depending on your performance. NOTE: We have not yet decided on a commission structure, if any.
Progressive Equity. We grant progressive equity to all new Grunts. This means that, in the case of a large exit (e.g., acquisition), the financial benefits get distributed more evenly across the whole team rather than solely going to the founders.
Medical/Dental/Vision Insurance. We offer a range of high-quality plans with a large portion paid by the company.
FSA and HSAs. We don't contribute to these accounts, but we do offer them as an option.
401(k). We contribute a portion of your salary to your pension or 401(k).
Disability insurance. If you get disabled, we have a policy that will pay out a portion of your salary.
Hardware budget. We'll buy you a brand new benchmark Apple laptop upon joining. It will be owned by you, not the company.
Personal Budget. We'll give you a personal budget of one thousand dollars per month to spend on your workspace (e.g., a co-working space), health (e.g., gym, yoga), time (e.g., babysitter), and/or learning (e.g., books, courses).
Minimum Vacation. We require that you take at least 4 weeks of vacation per year. And we'll track it to make sure you do!

Life First, Then Work
We believe in planning our work around our lives, not the other way around. To help achieve that we offer:

Remote work that lets you control your hours and physical location.
Normal working hours that usually amount to not more than ~40h per week, and no working on weekends or holidays.
Deliberate project planning that takes into account the time zone of all team members.
A minimum vacation policy where you must take at least 4 weeks per year away from work.
No one carrying a pager and no on-call rotation. We enable this by only offering support contracts with SLAs of responses on business days / hours only.

What time zones do we work in?
While Gruntwork generally hires anywhere between San Francisco and Berlin, candidates for this role must be within the GMT-7 to GMT-3 time zones, with a preference for being located in the USA or Canada. We expect you'll work primarily with customers and fellow Grunts in those time zones, with limited engagement with customers worldwide and Grunts in Europe. Working during reasonable hours is a priority for us.

15,Account Executive,Verikai,USA Only,"Company Introduction
Verikai is an insurance technology company changing the way the industry views risk with true predictive analytics. Our well-established database includes over 5,000 behavior attributes for 250+ million people in the United States and provides deep insight to these individuals’ true health risks. With this data, we help insurance companies improve underwriting precision, speed and efficiency using alternative data and machine learning – and ultimately, we provide consumers and small businesses with greater access to a broader range of insurance products.
Verikai isn’t your typical startup. And we aren’t looking for typical employees. For starters, we are a fully remote organization, meaning your home base can be your sofa, your favorite café, or a (wifi-equipped) cabin in the woods. All you need is your brain and a laptop…and we provide the laptop. We’re looking for people who want to do inspired work for a higher purpose. We are a growing and well-funded tech startup with a great product and even better ideas. If you want to make an immediate impact on the way the insurance industry operates while working in a fun, fast-paced and supportive environment, you’ve come to the right place.

We are looking for an experienced, quota-carrying, enterprise sales professional to drive revenue growth.

A passion for data/technology as well as a desire to constantly convey Verikai’s value to prospects is a must. Your target audience will be executives, underwriters, actuaries and brokers. 
Underwriting is an incredibly nuanced function within insurance; you will need to be consultative, persistent, patient, and flexible to win deals. Your ability to be a task master and collaborator is vital to progressing an enterprise sales cycle. You must be highly strategic, relying on both IQ and EQ to be successful. The type of person that fits the mold will be a complete self-starter, hard-working and gritty, while also utilizing critical thinking and analytical skills to solve problems.  
We are looking for someone who understands the health insurance players/landscape and can quickly establish key relationships that will drive our products into their underwriting process.

42,Sales Development Representative,User Interviews,USA Only,"About User Interviews
At User Interviews, we believe that the best companies in the world consistently deliver products and experiences that their customers love. We also believe that the only way to consistently build those products and experiences is to talk to your customers. Watch what they do. Understand why they do what they do. Figure out why they do things that seem irrational. And once you’ve done that once, do it again. Start having constant conversations. In short, make customers your #1 priority through user research.  
 
That’s why we exist. We help teams set up those conversations, allowing them to discover and embrace user insights. We currently do that by making it fast and easy to talk to customers, or potential customers, to help with product, design, or marketing decisions. We work with hundreds of companies every month, including user-centric organizations like Atlassian, Amazon, and Spotify.

Negotiation Skills; You will need to be able to confidently tell the entire story of a possible acquisition.

As you gain more experience, we are going to rely on you to make our process better and smoother for our sellers while also helping to increase the number of high-quality businesses that go live on our marketplace.
You will be paid $3,000 USD per month during the probation period. Following probation, you will be gradually introduced to our compensation plan. Within 12 months, you can expect to earn $50,000 – $60,000 USD per year depending on performance, and have paid, international healthcare coverage.

About AdQuick:
The company was born out of two frustrations with outdoor advertising: a slow, low-tech buying process and the inability to quantify the impact of campaigns. AdQuick solves both problems -- it aggregates the widest variety of inventory nationwide, allows advertisers to book online, and helps close the loop on campaigns with hard metrics on impact and results.
Founded in 2016 by Matt O'Connor, Fahim Ferdous, Vic Ramon, and Connor Burden, AdQuick has raised $3.2 million in venture funding and has 20+ employees in its Los Angeles, CA headquarters.
